<h3>History of the OD_BODS project</h3>
<ul>2020 Feb-Aug--- <a href="https://github.com/watty62">Ian</a> started an <a href="https://github.com/watty62/SOD/blob/master/Local_authorities.md">audit of Scottish Open Data</a></ul>
<ul>2021 Jun--- At <a href="https://codethecity.org/2021/06/13/3689/">CTC23</a>, a group of people worked on collating the sources and adding analysis, working from Ian's original audit. The OD_BODS team is born.</ul>
<ul>2021 Sep--- OD_BODS is presented at the Scottish Open Data Unconference 2021 <a href="http://sodu.live/">SODU21</a> to positive feedback and suggested that the project should continue</ul>

<ul>2021 Oct--- <a href="https://codethecity.org/">CodeTheCity</a> sponsors the opendata.scot domain for 2 years.</ul>
<ul>2021 Nov--- After a productive CTC24, the opendata.scot site is live with all 427 of the originally identified datasets listed.</ul>
<ul>2022 May--- Successful introduction of pipeline automation at CTC26 means the listing of data updates weekly on a Friday.</ul>
