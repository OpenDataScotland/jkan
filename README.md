## Contributing

Project management and issue reporting is managed from our [the_od_bods](https://github.com/OpenDataScotland/the_od_bods) repository.

## Getting started

Project-specific instructions to come. In the meantime you may find the [original JKAN documentation](https://github.com/timwis/jkan/wiki) helpful.

## Docker support
You can start this website using Docker by running `docker compose up` in your command line. Once the server is running you can access it at http://localhost:4000 or http://127.0.0.1:4000
