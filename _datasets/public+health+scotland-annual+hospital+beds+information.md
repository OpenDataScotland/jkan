notes: <p>In order to provide an effective, safe and efficient service to patients,
  hospitals must balance the provision of staffed beds against anticipated demand.
  Historically, the total number of beds has been reducing in line with evolving models
  of healthcare provision which aim to reduce the frequency and duration of hospital
  admissions and improve the integration of health and social care services. This
  strategy aims to improve outcomes for patients and reduce the likelihood of future
  hospital admissions.\r\n\r\nFurther information on hospital beds can be found in
  the <a href="https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/acute-hospital-activity-and-nhs-beds-information-annual/">recent
  annual publication</a>. \r\n\r\nThe date of the next release can be found on our
  list of <a href="https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/forthcoming-publications/">forthcoming
  publications</a>.\r\n\r\n__As part of making our open data output align better with
  our annual publication tables, we have applied column ordering to the Inpatient,
  Outpatient and Beds files in the September 2021 annual open data release consistent
  with the publication excel tables.__</p>
