notes: "<p>Trial the data: This dataset comprises text and images of the diary, letters\
  \ and poems of Marjory Fleming. Majory Fleming (1803-1811) was a Scottish child\
  \ author, born in Kirkcaldy, Fife, who became posthumously famous for her free-thinking\
  \ and precocious diaries. Written mainly in Edinburgh and the holiday retreats of\
  \ Ravelston and Braehead, they provide an authoritative record of Marjory\u2019\
  s life, schoolwork, and passing. The attention given to these diaries in the later\
  \ Victorian period saw her f\xEAted by men of letters, and embedded in the public\
  \ consciousness. The pages transcribed here form a portfolio of three volumes of\
  \ Marjory\u2019s diary (1810-1811), which were deposited in the National Library\
  \ of Scotland in 1930, and are a key source for those seeking a situational history\
  \ of early 19th century Scotland. This collection is the first Library dataset created\
  \ using HTR (Handwritten Text Recognition) software, which is a form of artificial\
  \ intelligence (AI). This involved hand-transcribing approximately 50 pages of Fleming\u2019\
  s diary in the Transkribus platform to build a model of her handwriting, which could\
  \ be applied to the whole collection. For further information see the readme and\
  \ METS files in this dataset.</p>"
