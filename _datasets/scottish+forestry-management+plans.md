notes: "<p>Management Plans provided a simpler alternative to Forest Plans for woodlands\
  \ under 100 hectares. They are required as part of the eligibility criteria for\
  \ SRDP grants. However no grant payments are available for the preparation of management\
  \ plans.\_ The Management Plan must give a clear and concise description of the\
  \ woodland and the indicative management proposals up to 10 years. These must be\
  \ in accordance with the principles of sustainable forest management as defined\
  \ by the UK Forestry Standard.    Basic attribute information is captured during\
  \ the digitising process. This is subsequently joined to more comprehensive information\
  \ which is entered in an Excel spreadsheet by Scottish Forestry Conservancy staff.\
  \    For more detailed information please see the metadata record on Scotland's\
  \ SpatialData.gov.scot Metadata Portal.</p>"
