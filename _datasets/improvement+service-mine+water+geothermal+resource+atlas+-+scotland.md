notes: "<p>A Web Mapping Feature layer identifying optimal locations across Scotland\
  \ for mine water geothermal development.</p>\n<p>Mine water geothermal energy describes\
  \ the low-carbon practice of using water held in abandoned flooded mines to heat\
  \ or cool surface thermal demands. The low temperatures (as low as 10\xB0C) require\
  \ heat pump technology to upgrade thermal energy to usable temperatures for heating\
  \ homes or industrial applications. The intention of the mine water geothermal resource\
  \ atlas is to highlight optimal areas to exploit MWG energy in Scotland. If the\
  \ scale of Scotland\u2019s mine water thermal resource, estimated at 12 GW, becomes\
  \ better communicated we envisage that this atlas will prove influential for increasing\
  \ the rate and success of MWG deployment. Ideally, the provision of feasible MWG\
  \ sites will influence stakeholder decisions i.e., where to invest and develop land\
  \ to make the best use of the low-carbon resource, resulting in MWG potential included\
  \ as part of a standard appraisal for a residential or industrial development plan.\
  \ Whilst it is acknowledged that focused expert input would be required to integrate\
  \ surface heat demand and subsurface resources in detail, the atlas provides non-experts\
  \ and decision makers with a first-pass high-level summary of the potential MWG\
  \ resource located within their area of interest. </p>\n<p>The four criteria for\
  \ site selection are summarised below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>There are more than one (overlapping)\
  \ mined seams.</li>\n<li>The mined seams are deeper than 30 m to minimise subsidence\
  \ risk.</li>\n<li>The mine water head (i.e., mine \u201Cwater table\u201D) is not\
  \ excessively deep (&lt; 60 m below ground level) to avoid excessive pumping costs.</li>\n\
  <li>The mined seams are shallower than 250 m below ground level to minimise drilling\
  \ costs.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As a result, this atlas has identified a total of 370.3\
  \ km2 across 19 local authority areas which are most suitable for MWG development.</p>\n\
  <p>Symbology:\n The calculated depths for mine water head (Criterion 3) are mapped\
  \ in 10 m increments with shallower values (0 m \u2013 20 m BGL) shown in shades\
  \ of pink and deeper values (20 m - 60 m BGL) shown in shades of blue. Where mine\
  \ water head is shallow (0 m - 20 m BGL) there may be some risk that reinjection\
  \ may cause mine water heads to approach the surface (depending on the transmissivity\
  \ of the workings). \u201COpen loop with discharge\u201D may be more feasible for\
  \ areas with very shallow mine water (0 m - 20 m BGL), but may require additional\
  \ permitting (discharge consents) and available land for treatment depending on\
  \ water chemistry. Areas shaded blue (20 m - 60 m BGL) correlate with deeper mine\
  \ water heads which are most suited to the \u2018open-loop with reinjection\u2019\
  \ configuration. Both configurations are presented in Walls et al. (2022) - https://doi.org/10.3390/en14196215.\
  \ Depths greater than 60 m BGL are not included since they indicate situations which\
  \ would face excessive pumping costs.</p>"
