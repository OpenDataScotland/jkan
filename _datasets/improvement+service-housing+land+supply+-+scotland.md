notes: <p>Local authorities are required to conduct an annual survey of the housing
  land supply, the Housing Land Audit, to determine completions within the timeframe
  and update forecasts of the housing land supply. This, in turn, helps inform land
  releases within the Local Development Plan process and ongoing development management
  decisions. A five-year effective housing land supply is required at all times.  This
  dataset contains full details - where available - of site references, completions
  and remaining supply. Further details of greenfield/brownfield status, tenure, effectiveness
  (deliverable within the period), constraints, planning details/status and developer
  are also provided where available.  The datasets have been drawn from a variety
  of sources, including comprehensive regional datasets (ClydePlan) and the joining
  of spatial and tabular data. This includes allocated and planned sites, which typically
  have fuller details of forecast phasing (etc) and also "windfall" and small sites
  (where included), which may be one-off rather than longer-term developments, with
  less detail. Some of these sites lack spatial geometry and have been represented
  by a square buffer on a recorded X/Y easting/northing, based on site size, if this
  information is available.</p>
