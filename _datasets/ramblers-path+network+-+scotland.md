notes: <p>Ramblers Scotland worked with partners, volunteers, and publicly available
  sources to create this path network dataset between 2019 and 2024. The Scottish
  Paths Map project has now been discontinued and the data is therefore no longer
  being updated but we are sharing it in the hope that it will be useful for a myriad
  of different future purposes.   The dataset includes almost 42,000 miles of paths
  in Scotland, at least half of which are not shown on Ordnance Survey maps, and there
  are over 2,000 paths that at the time they were mapped did not appear in any other
  dataset.  Volunteers also conducted 9,000 path surveys to gather the additional
  information that is available about some paths, and to remove paths from the map
  where they found that access rights did not apply or where they were entirely unsuitable
  for walking.   While Ramblers Scotland trained volunteers to carry out high-quality
  surveys, path audits will always be subjective to some extent. Users of this data
  planning to walk any of these paths should always follow the Scottish Outdoor Access
  Code.   If you have feedback, please contact Ramblers Scotland by emailing scotland@ramblers.org.uk.</p>
