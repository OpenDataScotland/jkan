notes: <p><b>This dataset is published as Open Data and provides information for the
  Stirling Council area.</b><div><br /></div><div><div>The National Records of Scotland
  (NRS) publishes the numbers of births for Local Authority areas and Health Board.</div><div><br
  /></div><div>NRS does not publish the numbers of births for geographical areas which
  are smaller than Local Authorities. However, some such information is available
  from other official web sites, which present information on births (produced from
  data which NRS supplied to those bodies) alongside other statistics for areas within
  Scotland.</div><div><br /></div><div>Other official web sites may also make available
  (for Scotland as a whole, or for areas within Scotland) figures which are on a different
  basis from those published by NRS - for example, they may provide age-sex-standardised
  rates which they produced using the European Standard Population.</div></div></p>
