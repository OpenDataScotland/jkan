notes: "<p>All GHiGs datasets cover the whole of Scotland and have been derived by\
  \ Greenspace Scotland over the project period of September 2020 to April 2021. Principal\
  \ third party data suppliers include:  - Ordnance Survey (greenspace and water body\
  \ data)  - Scottish Government (Scotland\u2019s Heat Map)  - Energy Saving Trust\
  \ (Home Analytics)  Please reference the Data Guide and Methodology report (attached\
  \ to the metadata record as an associated resource) and send any further queries\
  \ on the quality/ accuracy of the data to parkpower@greenspacescotland.org.uk. \
  \  GHiGs Settlements:   A public summary of indicators for GHiGs analysis of low\
  \ carbon heat based on data aggregated to Scotland\u2019s 516 settlements. Settlement\
  \ boundaries are from 2012 derived from National Records of Scotland to be consistent\
  \ with those used by Scotland\u2019s Heat Map v.2. Settlements are defined as places\
  \ with populations greater than 500. Approximately 90% of Scotland\u2019s population\
  \ lives in settlements. It is not clear why Scotland\u2019s Heat Map is using the\
  \ NRS 2012 settlement boundaries rather than the more recent NRS 2016 settlement\
  \ boundaries. Attributes were derived from Scotland\u2019s Heat Map with additional\
  \ attributes from GHiGs analysis and EST Home Analytics  GHiGs Settlements by LA:\
  \   A more comprehensive spreadsheet of tables used for National Findings Report\
  \ and all indicators for GHiGs analysis of low carbon heat based on data aggregated\
  \ to Scotland\u2019s 516 settlements and, separately, the 32 Local Authorities.\
  \ Settlement data aggregated to Local Authority geographies and presented based\
  \ on OS BoundaryLine Local Authority boundaries. The data excludes areas outside\
  \ settlements and therefore does NOT represent figures for complete local authorities.\
  \ This is particularly evident for Local Authorities with more significant populations\
  \ and businesses located outside of settlements. It includes most indicators used\
  \ in the GHiGs National Findings report based on analysis of low carbon heat related\
  \ data aggregated to Scotland\u2019s 516 settlements and then aggregated to 32 Local\
  \ Authorities.  GHiGs greenspaces:   Boundaries derived from OS Mastermap Greenspace.\
  \ Attributes derived from Scotland\u2019s Heat Map v.2 with additional attributes\
  \ from GHiGs analysis (see our Methodology Report) and EST Home Analytics  GHiGs\
  \ strategic greenspaces:   Subset of GHiGs Greenspaces based on selection criteria\
  \ to identify the 3% (3,446) of national greenspace sites with high potential for\
  \ supply of ground source heat (based on areal size / capacity) and have been classified\
  \ as \u2018high\u2019 based on local linear heat density. These sites are likely\
  \ to be the strongest candidates for larger scale ground source heat solutions,\
  \ potentially storing and feeding low grade heat into low carbon district heat networks.\
  \ The \u2018GSHP_Strategic_Importance\u2019 indicator category of \u2018VERY HIGH\u2019\
  \ was used to select this subset  GHiGs static water bodies:   Relatively static\
  \ water bodies greater than 1000m2 in area in proximity to urban settlements including\
  \ canals, lochs, lakes, flooded quarries/pits etc. derived largely from OS Mastermap\
  \ Greenspace. This data does not include rivers.  GHiGs DHN highest viability (Linear\
  \ Heat Density 16000 kWh/m/yr):   Linear Heat Density model created by Ramboll to\
  \ highlight areas where District Heat Networks (DHNs) have highest viability based\
  \ on heat demand from all buildings. Areas identifies have high levels of heat demand\
  \ density and are therefore highly suitable for DHNs \u2013 source of heat demand\
  \ data: Scotland\u2019s Heat Map v2.  GHiGs DHN high viability (Linear Heat Density\
  \ 8000 kWh/m/yr):   Linear Heat Density model created by Ramboll to highlight areas\
  \ where District Heat Networks (DHNs) have high viability based on heat demand from\
  \ all buildings \u2013 source of heat demand data: Scotland\u2019s Heat Map v2.\
  \  GHiGs DHN viable (Linear Heat Density 4000 kWh/m/yr):   Linear Heat Density model\
  \ created by Ramboll to highlight areas where District Heat Networks (DHNs) are\
  \ viable based on heat demand from all buildings. Threshold of 4000 is widely used\
  \ across the industry for Linear Heat Density modelling to identify areas with DHN\
  \ viability. Polygons of area less than 250m2 were deleted which reduced the number\
  \ of polygon features by 80% to cut file size. Source of heat demand data: Scotland\u2019\
  s Heat Map v2.  GHiGs DHN highest viability public buildings only (Linear Heat Density\
  \ 16000 kWh/m/yr):   Linear Heat Density model created by Ramboll based on a best\
  \ estimate of public buildings to highlight areas where District Heat Networks have\
  \ highest viable based on heat demand from only public buildings. Source of heat\
  \ demand data: Scotland\u2019s Heat Map v2.  GHiGs DHN high viability public buildings\
  \ only (Linear Heat Density 8000 kWh/m/yr):   Linear Heat Density model created\
  \ by Ramboll based on a best estimate of public buildings to highlight areas where\
  \ District Heat Networks have high viability based on heat demand from only public\
  \ buildings. Source of heat demand data: Scotland\u2019s Heat Map v2.  GHiGs DHN\
  \ viable public buildings only (Linear Heat Density 4000 kWh/m/yr):   Linear Heat\
  \ Density model created by Ramboll based on a best estimate of public buildings\
  \ to highlight areas where District Heat Networks are viable based on heat demand\
  \ from only public buildings. Threshold of 4000 is widely used across the industry\
  \ for Linear Heat Density modelling to identify areas with DHN viability \u2013\
  \ source of heat demand data: Scotland\u2019s Heat Map v2.  GHiGs public buildings:\
  \   Subset of Scotland\u2019s Heat Map at building level where buildings are assessed\
  \ as likely to be publicly owned based on a selection of 125 OS AddressBase codes\
  \ (see GHiGs Methodology report for details). This is the best available approximation\
  \ of publicly owned buildings but will exclude those publicly owned buildings which\
  \ are leased to third parties for more commercial-type services. This same identification\
  \ method was the basis for creating the 3 Linear Heat Density map layers for public\
  \ buildings only.  GHiGs public buildings with heat demand greater than 50 MWh/year:\
  \  Subset of \u2018GHiGs public buildings\u2019 dataset based on a filter for all\
  \ those public buildings with an annual heat demand of 50 MWh or more. Multi-occupancy\
  \ buildings like flatted properties are treated as separate buildings and therefore\
  \ they are unlikely to appear in this dataset.  GHiGs public buildings (&gt;200\
  \ MWh) near greenspaces (&gt;200 MWh):  Subset of \u2018GHiGs public buildings\u2019\
  \ dataset where: (1) buildings are assessed as likely to be publicly owned based\
  \ on a selection of 125 OS AddressBase codes and have a heat demand of at least\
  \ 200 MWh; AND (2) they are located within 50m of a greenspace that, based on 20%\
  \ space utilisation, could meet at least 200 MWh in terms of heat production from\
  \ its available area. In effect this is a subset of public building locations that\
  \ offers the strongest opportunities for larger scale GSHP projects based on use\
  \ of nearby greenspace. Multi-occupancy buildings like flatted properties are treated\
  \ as separate buildings and therefore examples such as high rise flats next to larger\
  \ areas of greenspace are unlikely to appear in this dataset.  GHiGs waste disposal\
  \ sites:  Potential sources of waste heat from waste disposal sites to feed into\
  \ district heat networks \u2013 source: SEPA registered waste sites   All GHiGs\
  \ datasets cover Scotland and have been derived over the project period of September\
  \ 2020 to April 2021. Principal third party data suppliers include: \u2022 Ordnance\
  \ Survey (greenspace and water body data) \u2022 Scottish Government (Scotland\u2019\
  s Heat Map) \u2022 Energy Saving Trust (Home Analytics)</p>"
