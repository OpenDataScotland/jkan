notes: '<p>This data provides a quarterly update on waiting times for people accessing
  specialist drug and alcohol treatment services. In 2011, the Scottish Government
  set a standard that 90% of people referred for help with problematic drug or alcohol
  use will wait no longer than three weeks for specialist treatment that supports
  their recovery. This data was extracted from the new Drug and Alcohol Information
  System (DAISy) and its predecessor the Drug and Alcohol Treatment Waiting Times
  (DATWT) database. DAISy was implemented in four NHS Boards (Ayrshire &amp; Arran,
  Dumfries &amp; Galloway, Grampian and Western Isles) from December 2020, and was
  available in all NHS Boards from April 2021.</p>
