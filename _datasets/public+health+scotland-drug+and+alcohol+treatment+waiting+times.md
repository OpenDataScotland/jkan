notes: <p>Data are presented on referrals and waiting times for people accessing specialist
  drug and alcohol services in Scotland. Information available includes waiting times
  for drug and alcohol treatment referrals where the person either started treatment
  during the quarter (a completed wait) or were waiting to start treatment at the
  end of the quarter (an ongoing wait). In addition, information describing the referrals
  received, the demographics of people starting treatment and the types of treatments
  started is also available. \r\n\r\nData includes breakdowns by NHS Board, Alcohol
  and Drug Partnership, service type (community-based or prison-based) and the substance(s)
  people sought help for. \r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Prior to 27/09/2022, this dataset was
