notes: <p>Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new strain of coronavirus first identified
  in Wuhan, China. Clinical presentation may range from mild-to-moderate illness to
  pneumonia or severe acute respiratory infection. \r\n\r\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has
  wider impacts on individuals\u2019 health, and their use of healthcare services,
  than those that occur as the direct result of infection.\r\nReasons for this may
  include:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Individuals being reluctant to use health services because
  they do not want to burden the NHS or are anxious about the risk of infection.\r\n\r\n\u2022
  The health service delaying preventative and non-urgent care such as some screening
  services and planned surgery.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Other indirect effects of interventions
  to control COVID-19, such as mental or physical consequences of distancing measures.\r\n\r\nThis
  dataset provides a weekly summary of people attending A&amp;E departments (Emergency
  Departments and Nurse/GP led minor injury units) in the recent past, along with
  historical activity for comparison purposes. The recent trend data is shown by age
  group, sex and broad deprivation category (SIMD). Information is also available
  at different levels of geographical breakdown such as Health Boards, Health and
  Social Care partnerships, and Scotland totals. \r\n\r\nThis data is also available
