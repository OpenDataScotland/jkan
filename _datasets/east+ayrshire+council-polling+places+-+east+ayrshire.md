notes: "<p>A Polling District is a geographical subdivision of an electoral area such\
  \ as an electoral Ward within which a polling place is designated.</p>\n<p>The Representation\
  \ of the People Act 1983 places a duty on LA to divide the local authority area\
  \ into polling districts based on ward boundaries, and to designate a polling place\
  \ for each district. LAs also have a duty to keep these polling arrangements under\
  \ review. The Electoral Administration Act 2006 introduced amendments to the 1983\
  \ Act (which in turn has been superseded by The Electoral Administration Act 2013).\
  \ Now local authorities must conduct a full review (with public consultation) of\
  \ its polling districts and polling places every four years, however adjustments\
  \ to the boundaries of polling districts and the designation of polling places within\
  \ LA wards can be proposed at any time in response to changes in ward boundaries\
  \ or to the availability of premises that can be reasonably designated as polling\
  \ places.</p>\n<p>The Fifth Review of Electoral Arrangements concluded in May 2016\
  \ when the LGBCS made recommendations to Scottish Ministers for the number of Councillors\
  \ and the electoral ward boundaries in each of Scotland's 32 local authorities.\
  \ The review recommended changes in 30 LA areas of which all but 5 were accepted\
  \ and came into force on 30th Sept 2016. As a result, ward boundaries (and therefore\
  \ polling districts and possibly polling places) were changed after this date in\
  \ time for the May 2017 elections.</p>\n<p>The following fields are now MANDATORY\
  \ fields for this dataset.\n \"district_code\" - The polling district code linked\
  \ to the polling place\n \"UPRN\" - The Unique Property Reference Number for the\
  \ Corporate Address Gazeteer record of the polling place\n \"polling_place\" - The\
  \ name and/or address of the polling place (based on the Corporate Address Gazeteer\
  \ record)</p>"
