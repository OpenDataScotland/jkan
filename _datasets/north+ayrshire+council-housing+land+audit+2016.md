  Planning Policy ( SPP) requires that a five-year ongoing effective land supply is
  available to meet the identified housing land requirements. Planning authorities
  should therefore carry out regular monitoring of housing completions and the progress
  of sites through the planning process. This can be achieved through the preparation
  of a housing land audit, carried out annually by the planning authority in conjunction
  with housing and infrastructure providers.</span></p>'
