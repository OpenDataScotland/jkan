notes: '<p>This dataset contains multiple themed layers of different types of sporting
  facilities across Scotland. The facilities are represented as point locations, which
  have been captured against Google Maps (along with attributes and details about
  them). Where there are multiple sports facilities at the same location there will
  be multiple points, meaning that calculations of total numbers of facilities can
  be calculated easily.  Where there were missing coordinates for some facilities,
  manual lookups of appropriate coordinates have been made. Also, a judgement has
  been made to delete some provided facilities where they appear to no longer exist
  (for whatever reason).  Provided layers are: - Athletics Tracks (incl velodromes,
  training areas, indoor and outdoor) - Bowling Greens (incl croquet, petanque and
  cricket squares) - Fitness Suites - Golf Courses - Ice Rinks (incl curling rinks)
  - Pitches (incl size, sport and type) - Sports Halls (incl gyms and other types)
  - Squash Court - Swimming Pools (incl diving and other types) - Indoor Tennis Courts
  - Outdoor Tennis Courts  Please note that the information provided is provided by
  third parties and therefore we cannot guarantee its accuracy, but it is the most
  up to date information we hold.    As part of our work to keep this data up to date,
  we would kindly request that if you identify any issues, you share this with sportscotland
