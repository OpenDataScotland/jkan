notes: "<p>Local Nature Reserves are areas of (at least) locally important natural\
  \ heritage, designated and managed by local authorities to give people better opportunities\
  \ to learn about and enjoy nature close to where they live. They are found across\
  \ the country, but generally close to towns and cities.\n More details are available\
  \ here: https://www.nature.scot/professional-advice/protected-areas-and-species/protected-areas/local-designations/local-nature-reserves\n\
  \ Where we have not been supplied with data by local authorities we are extracting\

  \ designation date, website URL (for more information) and PA code are all mandatory\
