notes: <p>This dataset provides information on number of new weekly confirmed cases
  from influenza and other respiratory pathogens in Scotland, including rates at Scotland
  and NHS Board. Age groups and sex breakdowns are also available in this dataset.\r\nRespiratory
  infection can be caused by a number of pathogens and there is no single surveillance
  system that describes the onset, severity and impact of SARS-CoV-2, influenza and
  other respiratory pathogens, or the success of any control measures. In Scotland,
  respiratory infection and associated morbidity are monitored using enhanced surveillance,
  which combines data from microbiological sampling and laboratory test results from
  community and hospital settings with data from syndromic surveillance of NHS 24
  calls, primary care consultations for respiratory symptoms, and hospital (including
  intensive care) admissions. The intelligence generated from the different areas
  of surveillance provide a comprehensive picture of current respiratory illness in
  Scotland. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, most influenza infections would be expected
  to occur in the winter months with a peak between December and March. There are
  three types of influenza virus, Type A, B and C, that cause illness in humans. Types
  A and B more commonly detected through testing. The virus undergoes some level of
  genetic change each year, often referred to as shift (major genetic change) or drift
  (minor genetic change); this is most notable for influenza A viruses. This genetic
  change causes different strains of the virus to predominate each season. As such,
  the number of people affected each year depends on how well the vaccine is matched
  against the circulating strain and how many people access the vaccination. \r\nThe
  key non-influenza respiratory pathogens include adenovirus, seasonal coronaviruses
  (non-SARS-CoV-2), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human parainfluenza virus (HPIV),
  Mycoplasma pneumoniae, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus. These mostly
  cause mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, such as the common cold, but infection
  can sometimes lead to more severe lower respiratory tract complications, especially
  in young children, the elderly and those with weakened immune systems. Symptoms
  may also include a variety of non-respiratory presentations.\r\n</p>
