notes: "<p>Most councils keep records of their car parks, bays and zones, including\
  \ parking-related TROs (Traffic Regulation Orders). Therefore we have tried to compile\
  \ these into consistent national layers.</p>\n<p>Currently, we publish four layers:\n\
  \ - Car Parks - a polygon layer\n - Car Parks - a point layer\n - Parking Bays -\
  \ a polygon layer\n - Parking Zones - a polygon layer</p>\n<p>Any supplied line\
  \ records (usually TROs) have been buffered by 2m to create a representative area\
  \ and incorporate them into the national polygon layers.</p>\n<p>Car park data is\
  \ collected for a myriad of different reasons and purposes and the attribution for\
  \ each local authorities can be very different (though we've tried to include as\
  \ much info as possible). For these reasons the data provided may not be up to date\
  \ nor complete.</p>"
