  <p>A Prime Retail area in a local development plan is a key commercial zone with
  high foot traffic and concentrated retail businesses. The plan aims to boost attractiveness
  and accessibility through infrastructure improvements, better transportation, pedestrian-friendly
  spaces, and aesthetic upgrades. This creates vibrant commercial hubs that support
  the local economy and offer diverse shopping and dining experiences for residents
  and visitors.</p>'
