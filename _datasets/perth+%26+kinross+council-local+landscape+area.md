notes: <div style='text-align:Left;font-size:12pt'><p><span>PKC designated landscapes
  within Perth and Kinross which merit special attention, either because they are
  of particular value and warrant protection or because they are degraded and require
  active management or positive restoration, or are under threat from inappropriate
  development. The associated LDP Landscape Supplementary Guidance in which they are
  contained was first approved by Scottish Ministers on 17th June 2015 and readopted
  by Perth &amp; Kinross Council in 2020. The polygons were digitised by Land Use
  Consultants, the Consultants hired to undertake the study to identify the LLAs.  </span></p></div>
