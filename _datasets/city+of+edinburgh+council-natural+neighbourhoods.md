  are neighbourhood definitions and boundaries created during a consultation with
  Edinburgh residents. Natural neighbourhood boundaries were created in 2004 as part
  of a review of ward boundaries. The city has changed much since then, the population
  has increased, new neighbourhoods have appeared and demolition has taken place in
  other areas so the 2014 consultation has updated these boundaries. The boundaries
  will be used by the Council and its partners to plan services, consultations and
  inform policy and strategy development.</span></p>
