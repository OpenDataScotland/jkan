notes: "<div><b>This dataset is published as Open Data and taken directly from Police\
  \ Scotland's Road Traffic Collision Dataset.</b></div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>The\
  \ dataset has been manipulated to show reportable Road Traffic Collisions within\
  \ the Stirling Council area and is a join between Collision and Casualty data available\
  \ here, https://www.scotland.police.uk/about-us/how-we-do-it/road-traffic-collision-data/\_\
  </div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>Supporting information about the data from Police\
  \ Scotland:</div>\n<div><ul><li>Please note that these data are not official statistics.</li><li>These\
  \ management information data are not directly comparable with official statistics.\
  \ The data published here is for recorded collisions from January 1st\_ Data before\
  \ this date are already available online at the Department for Transport (see below).</li><li>All\
  \ data are provisional and should be treated as management information. These data\
  \ were extracted from Police Scotland internal systems and are published quarterly.\
  \ Management information are extracted, and will be correct, as at July 2nd; October\
  \ 2nd; January 2nd; and April 2nd.\_ Historical data are refreshed to show the most\
  \ current recorded information.</li><li>During 2019 Police Scotland adopted the\
  \ CRaSH (Collision Recording and Sharing) data recording and management solution.\
  \ This is one of the first national IT solutions implemented by Police Scotland,\
  \ which is also used by over half of the police forces in England and Wales. The\
  \ system is owned by the Department for Transport, and further information is available\
  \ on the CRaSH website.</li><li>Before the introduction of CRaSH provision of STATS19\
  \ data (see below) was reliant on collating data from a number of different legacy\
  \ Force IT systems. Due to differences in data structure and recording practices\
  \ or processes, these data do not have the same level of consistency as that available\
  \ from CRaSH.\_ However, RTC data (designated as national statistics) for the period\
  \ before 2020 are published on the Department for Transport website.</li><li>Within\
  \ the United Kingdom, recording of road traffic collision (RTC) data is governed\
  \ by the STATS19 data collection form, with guidance provided by the STATS20 Manual\
  \ (Instructions for the completion of road accident reports from non-CRASH sources).\
  \ Further details and access to these documents is available through the Department\
  \ for Transport website.\_</li><li>COVID-19 : During 2020/21 there were a variety\
  \ of COVID pandemic restrictions and lockdowns.\_ It is recommended that the primary\
  \ comparator to use as a baseline is a five-year average.\_ Where this is not available,\
  \ then a three-year average should be used.\_ Where comparisons are made between\
  \ 2020/21 and 2019/20 caution should be used when interpreting time series or analytical\
  \ results.</li><li>National statistics for RTCs and Casualties are routinely published\
  \ by Transport Scotland and the Department for Transport.</li></ul></div>\n<div>For\
