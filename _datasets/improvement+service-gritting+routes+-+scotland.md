notes: '<p>Each local authority creates gritting routes and regimes to keep their
  most important roads (and in some cases footpaths) and networks clear come bad winter
  weather. Most LAs create these as line datasets. So the national dataset is a line
  format dataset.   We now have two layers: one for road gritting and one for footpath.  Some
  LAs collect this data as a polygon dataset. We are working with them to convert
  this into line formats in the future.  We have removed trunk roads that are cleared
  by private companies e.g BEAR and AMEY from this dataset for the time being as they
  aren''t currently under the LA gritting route regime.  Eventually, the Street Gazetteer
  will enable us to identify these routes more accurately and coherently.</p>'
