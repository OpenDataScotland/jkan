notes: <p>Local government in Scotland comprises 32 unitary local authorities, which
  are responsible for the provision of a range of public services such as education,
  licensing regulations, social care, transport and waste management. The current
  authority boundaries are largely a result of reorganization that took place in 1996,
  following the enactment of the Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994 which abolished
  the two tier structure of regions and districts.  The Local Government Boundary
  Commission for Scotland is responsible for recommendations on the definition of
  local authority boundaries, however, the definitive dataset is delineated by Ordnance
  Survey for inclusion in their BoundaryLine product.</p>
