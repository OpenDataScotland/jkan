notes: <p>This dataset presents information on COVID-19 vaccinations delivered to
  pregnant women in Scotland.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has been
  used since the start of the vaccination programme on 8 December 2020. The Oxford/Astrazeneca
  vaccine has been used from 4 January 2021 and the Moderna vaccine from 7 April 2021.
  \r\n\r\nWomen can receive a first or second dose, or both doses, of COVID-19 vaccination
  during pregnancy, depending on when they become eligible for vaccination and how
  this relates to the dates of their pregnancy.\r\n\r\nPHS has generated this information
  on COVID-19 vaccinations delivered to pregnant women by linking national data on
  vaccinations to the COVID-19 in Pregnancy in Scotland (COPS) study database of pregnant
  women in Scotland.\r\n\r\nAs part of the COPS study, PHS is regularly linking together
  a wide range of health records to identify women who are, or recently have been,
  pregnant.  The specific records used include:\r\n\r\n- Records of booking for antenatal
  care\r\n- GP records relating to miscarriage\r\n- Hospital discharge records relating
  to miscarriage or delivery of a live or stillborn baby\r\n- Statutory termination
  of pregnancy notification records\r\n- Statutory live or stillbirth registration
  records\r\n- NHS live birth notification records.\r\n\r\nUsing these records, we
  have identified all women in Scotland who were pregnant on 1 March 2020 (the start
  of the COVID-19 pandemic), and all women who have subsequently become pregnant.  \r\n\r\nThe
  study database is refreshed every month with new pregnancies added to the database,
  and previous records of ongoing pregnancies updated as required, for example if
  a woman has recently delivered her baby.\r\n\r\nFurther details on the COPS study
  are available on the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/usher/research/projects/covid-19-pregnancy-scotland">Usher
  Institute webpage</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland/COPS-public">PHS
