  \ Council is a voluntary organisation set up by statute by the Local Authority and\
  \ run by local residents to act on behalf of its area. As the most local tier of\
  \ elected representation, Community Councils play an important role in local democracy.\
  \ Community Councils are made up of people who care about their communities and\
  \ want to make their area a better place to live. Community Councillors represent\
  \ local people, voice peoples\u2019 views on important decisions which affect them\
  \ and work with others to improve services. A range of people must be part of a\
  \ Community Council so different opinions and ideas are heard.<br /></div><div><br\
  \ /></div><div>Community Council enquiries are logged and managed by the Community\
  \ Council co-ordinator with each being sent to the relevant service area within\
  \ the authority. This dataset summarises number of enquiries by month, community\
  \ council, and recipient service.</div></p>"
