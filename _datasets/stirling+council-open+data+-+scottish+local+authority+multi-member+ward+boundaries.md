  <div><div>Boundaries Scotland is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations\
  \ to Scottish Ministers for local authority boundaries and electoral arrangements\
  \ in Scotland. Electoral reviews make recommendations on the overall number of councillors\
  \ in each local authority and number of councillors in each ward (each Mainland\
  \ ward must elect either 3 or 4 councillors, Island wards may have between 1 and\
  \ 4 councillors depending on their size); the number of wards for local government\
  \ elections and their boundaries; and the extent of council areas. Electoral reviews\
  \ are undertaken roughly every 8 to 12 years. Recommendations that are accepted\
  \ by Ministers are enacted by statutory instrument and passed to Ordnance Survey\
  \ for inclusion in their BoundaryLine product.</div><div><br /></div><div>Following\
  \ the reorganisation of councils into the 32 unitary local authorities, 1,245 electoral\
  \ boundaries were defined following direction from the Secretary of State in accordance\
  \ with Schedule 2 of the Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994. Since then, a\
  \ number of formal reviews of electoral arrangements and administrative areas have\
  \ taken place.</div></div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>Source:\_\
