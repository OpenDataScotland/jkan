notes: '<p>Allotments are plots of land that are rented by individuals or organisations
  for the purpose of growing fruit, vegetables and/or flowers. There are several allotment
  sites in Dundee but not all of them are run by the council itself. Dundee City Council
  has four sites: Arklay Terrace, Ancrum Road, Magdalen Green and Macaulay St. All
  the others are either private or devolved sites and are therefore responsible for
  their own charges and waiting lists so should be contacted directly. If you wish
  to be placed on the waiting list for a DCC allotment plot, please email environment@dundeecity.gov.uk
  Allotment charges are currently set at \xa35.10 (\xa34.10 concession) per annum
  per pole (a unit of area of about 25 m2). Allotment sizes vary slightly so the total
  cost is different for each plot but a full size plot averages 10 poles and would
  therefore cost about \xa351 per year.</p>'
