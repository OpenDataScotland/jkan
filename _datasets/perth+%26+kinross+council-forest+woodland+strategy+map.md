notes: "<div style='text-align:left;'><div><p style='font-size:12pt;'><span>The Strategy\
  \ is a land use plan to help identify areas where proposals for woodland creation\
  \ and management may be supported and activities that will be encouraged through\
  \ available funding.   The extent to which specific proposals in potential areas\
  \ will be supported will depend on site specific criteria detailed with in action\
  \ plans,  individual forest management plans, the Forest Design Framework etc. \
  \ The design of schemes will require careful consideration.  (For further detail\
  \ see https://www.pkc.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=28220&amp;p=0)</span></p><p style='font-size:12pt;'><span>CLASS:</span></p><p\
  \ style='font-size:12pt;'><span>PREFERRED:  Land will be that which offers the greatest\
  \ scope to accommodate future expansion of a range of woodland types, and hence,\
  \ to deliver on a very wide range of objectives. Within preferred areas sensitivities\
  \ are, in general, likely to be limited, and it should be possible to address any\
  \ particular site specific issues within well designed proposals that meet the UK\
  \ Forestry Standard and associated guidelines. Most expansion is therefore likely\
  \ to be focused on preferred areas.</span></p><p style='font-size:12pt;'><span>POTENTIAL:\
  \  Land will be that which offers considerable potential to accommodate future expansion\
  \ of a range of woodland types, but where at least one significant sensitivity exists.\
  \ The extent to which specific proposals in potential areas will be supported will\
  \ depend on how well sensitivities can be addressed within the proposals. The design\
  \ of schemes will require careful consideration</span></p><p style='font-size:12pt;'><span>SENSITIVE:\
  \  Areas where a combination of sensitivities means there will be limited scope\
  \ to accommodate further woodland expansion unless that expansion demonstrably does\
  \ not impact negatively on the identified sensitivity. Limited woodland expansion\
  \ may be possible within sensitive areas where it is of a scale and character which\
  \ can be accommodated without significant negative impacts and/or where it would\
  \ positively enhance the features of interest locally. In some areas cumulative\
  \ impact may also be a relevant consideration.</span></p><p style='font-size:12pt;'><span>UNSUITABLE:\
  \  Areas assessed as being physically unsuitable for the growth and management of\
  \ trees (based on the Land Capability for Forestry Map)</span></p><p><span style='font-family:Calibri,\
