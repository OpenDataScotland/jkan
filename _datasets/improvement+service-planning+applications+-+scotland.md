notes: "<p>'Development management' is the name given to the process of deciding planning\
  \ applications and various other associated activities including enforcement of\
  \ planning controls. For the purposes of planning applications, development in Scotland\
  \ is put into one of three categories \u2013 'local', 'major' or 'national'. The\
  \ different categories mean that applications are treated in a way which is suited\
  \ to the size and complexity of the proposed development and the issues they are\
  \ likely to raise. Most applications will be for 'local' developments. 'Major' developments\
  \ include applications for 50 or more homes, certain waste, water, transport and\
  \ energy-related developments, and larger retail developments. 'National' developments\
  \ are specific projects which have been identified in the National Planning Framework\
  \ because of their national importance. Scottish Ministers become involved in a\
  \ small minority of cases, but only do so where it involves a matter of genuine\
  \ national interest.  This dataset consists of 4 separate layers:   1. Planning\
  \ Applications - Weekly Lists (Points):\_\_A point layer showing an amalgamation\
  \ of the current calendar year's weekly lists for all Scottish planning authorities\
  \ in terms of applications registered and/or decided by a planning authority. This\
  \ should be a complete dataset across Scotland using X/Y co-ordinates, UPRN or postcode\
  \ as corresponding\_geometry. This is categorised by application status, planning\
  \ authority and date of weekly list. 2. Planning Applications - Weekly Lists (Polygons):\_\
  A polygon layer showing an amalgamation of the current calendar year's weekly lists\
  \ for most Scottish\_planning\_authorities in terms of\_applications registered\
  \ and/or decided by a planning authority. This is only for authorities that publish\
  \ site boundary\_mapping data online.\_This is\_categorised\_by application status,\
  \ planning authority and date of weekly list. 3. Planning Applications - historic\
  \ year data back to 1990 (Points):\_A Point layer for all previous year's planning\
  \ applications with summary details for\_most\_Scottish\_planning\_authorities.\
  \ This is only for authorities that publish site boundary\_mapping data online and\
  \ is not complete across Scotland. NB. This layer can be filtered for individual\
  \ year by selecting the 'shapefile' or 'GeoJSON' download option or the Web Feature\
  \ Service can be filtered using appropriate software such as a desktop GIS. 4. Planning\
  \ Applications - historic year data back to 1990 (Polygons):\_A polygon layer for\
  \ all previous year's planning applications with summary details for\_most\_Scottish\_\
  planning\_authorities. This is only for authorities that publish site boundary\_\
  mapping data online and is not complete across Scotland. NB. This layer can be filtered\
  \ for individual year by selecting the 'shapefile' or 'GeoJSON' download option\
  \ or the Web Feature Service can be filtered using appropriate software such as\
  \ a desktop GIS.  This data is collected and published weekly (for weekly lists)\
  \ and this metadata record is updated weekly.  We strongly recommend that, when\
  \ using the WFS for this dataset, because of it's size you should use it with a\
  \ filter.  <em>Moray's planning data has currently been removed from this dataset.\
  \ We will find a solution to this in due course</em></p>"
