notes: "<p><em>From 24 March 2022, Public Health Scotland (PHS) began reporting the\
  \ number of people who have received a fourth dose of Covid-19 vaccination. Vaccine\
  \ uptake statistics among care home residents and those who are severely immunosuppressed\
  \ will be reported initially. PHS will include further updates as the Spring/Summer\
  \ vaccination programme rolls out.</em></p>\n<p><em>In addition, as part of our\
  \ continuous review of reporting, PHS made some changes to vaccine uptake statistics.\
  \ From 24 March 2022, the deceased and those who no longer live in Scotland are\
  \ no longer be included in vaccine uptake statistics.  Historic trend data have\
  \ been updated to take into account this new methodology for all apart from the\
  \ Daily Trends by JCVI Priority Group table (more details about the data in this\
  \ table are below).  Scotland level data for all vaccinations administered (i.e.\
  \ including those who have since died or moved from Scotland) are still available\
  \ in the Daily Trend of All Vaccinations Delivered in Scotland table.</em></p>\n\
  <p><em>Also from 24 March 2022, Dose 3/Booster doses are termed \u201CDose 3\u201D\
  .</em></p>\n<p><strong>To allow new data to be fully processed and available at\
  \ 14:00, the Daily COVID-19 in Scotland and COVID-19 Vaccination in Scotland datasets\
  \ will be temporarily unavailable from 12:45 to 14:00. During this window, the datasets\
  \ will not be visible and any queries made to these datasets will return a 404 \u2013\
  \ Not found error. At all other times the datasets will be available in full as\
  \ usual.</strong></p>\n<p>PHS reviewed the JCVI priority group uptake figures from\
  \ 18 November 2021, specifically how we derive the numerator and the denominator.\
  \  The rational for the change is to ensure we report on most up to date living\
  \ population for each group.  For this, the list of individuals in each cohort has\
  \ been refreshed to be more current.  We have also removed individuals who have\
  \ since died to reflect the current living population. From the 24 March 2022 those\
  \ who are no longer living in Scotland have also been removed from the numerator\
  \ and denominator for JCVI priority group uptake figures.</p>\n<p>This means all\
  \ the JCVI cohorts and populations have changed for both numerator and denominators\
  \ on these two dates and care should be taken when interpreting trends.</p>\n<p>On\
  \ 08 December 2020, a Coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine developed by Pfizer BioNTech\
  \ (Comirnaty) was first used in the UK as part of national immunisation programmes.\
  \ The AstraZeneca (Spikevax) vaccine was also approved for use in the national programme,\
  \ and rollout of this vaccine began on 04 January 2021. Moderna (Vaxzevria) vaccine\
  \ was approved for use on 8 January 2021 and rollout of this vaccine began on 07\
  \ April 2021.</p>\n<p>These vaccines have met strict standards of safety, quality\
  \ and effectiveness set out by the independent Medicines and Healthcare Products\
  \ Regulatory Agency (MHRA). </p>\n<p>Those giving the vaccine to others were the\
  \ first to receive the vaccination. In the first phase of the programme, NHS Scotland\
  \ followed the independent advice received from the <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/948353/Priority_groups_for_coronavirus__COVID-19__vaccination_-_advice_from_the_JCVI__2_December_2020.pdf\"\
  >Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI)</a> and prioritised delivery\
  \ of the vaccine to those with the greatest clinical need, in line with the recommended\
  \ order of prioritisation.  For booster vaccinations a similar approach has been\
  \ adopted. </p>\n<p>Definitions used in the vaccine uptake by JCVI priority group\
  \ resource can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/covid-19-vaccination-in-scotland/resource/29e8ab8e-065a-4f92-ab70-4371d757633b\"\
  >JCVI Priority Group Definitions table</a>. Individuals can appear in more than\
  \ one JCVI priority group.</p>\n<p>A 2-dose primary schedule is advised for the\
  \ vaccines - followed by a booster dose and a secondary booster for those aged 75+\
  \ or in certain JCVI priority groups. For the Pfizer BioNTech (Comirnaty) vaccine,\
  \ the second vaccine dose can be offered between 3 to 12 weeks after the first dose.\
  \ For the AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria) and Moderna (Spikevax) vaccine, the second dose\
  \ can be offered 4 to 12 weeks after the first dose.  First booster doses are offered\
  \ 12 weeks after 2nd dose. Second boosters are offered 24 weeks after the initial\
  \ booster. Those are in the severely immuno-suppressed priority group will receive\
  \ a 3rd primary dose before being eligible for a first booster.</p>\n<p>This dataset\
  \ provides information on daily number of COVID vaccinations in Scotland. Data on\
  \ the total number of vaccinations in Scotland is presented by day administered\
  \ and vaccine type, by age group, by sex, by non-age cohorts and by geographies\
  \ (NHS Board and Local Authority). As the population in the cohorts can change with\
  \ time, these will be refined when updated data are available.</p>\n<p>Additional\
