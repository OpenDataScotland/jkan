notes: <p><strong>This dataset is no longer updated, find vaccination data <a href="https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/flu-covid-vaccinations">here</a></strong>\r\n\r\n_From
  24 March 2022, Public Health Scotland (PHS) began reporting the number of people
  who have received a fourth dose of Covid-19 vaccination. Vaccine uptake statistics
  among care home residents and those who are severely immunosuppressed will be reported
  initially. PHS will include further updates as the Spring/Summer vaccination programme
  rolls out.<em>\r\n\r\n_In addition, as part of our continuous review of reporting,
  PHS made some changes to vaccine uptake statistics. From 24 March 2022, the deceased
  and those who no longer live in Scotland are no longer be included in vaccine uptake
  statistics.  Historic trend data have been updated to take into account this new
  methodology for all apart from the Daily Trends by JCVI Priority Group table (more
  details about the data in this table are below).  Scotland level data for all vaccinations
  administered (i.e. including those who have since died or moved from Scotland) are
  still available in the Daily Trend of All Vaccinations Delivered in Scotland table.</em>\r\n\r\n_Also
  from 24 March 2022, Dose 3/Booster doses are termed \u201cDose 3\u201d._\r\n\r\n<strong>To
  allow new data to be fully processed and available at 14:00, the Daily COVID-19
  in Scotland and COVID-19 Vaccination in Scotland datasets will be temporarily unavailable
  from 12:45 to 14:00. During this window, the datasets will not be visible and any
  queries made to these datasets will return a 404 \u2013 Not found error. At all
  other times the datasets will be available in full as usual.</strong>\r\n\r\nPHS
  reviewed the JCVI priority group uptake figures from 18 November 2021, specifically
  how we derive the numerator and the denominator.  The rational for the change is
  to ensure we report on most up to date living population for each group.  For this,
  the list of individuals in each cohort has been refreshed to be more current.  We
  have also removed individuals who have since died to reflect the current living
  population. From the 24 March 2022 those who are no longer living in Scotland have
  also been removed from the numerator and denominator for JCVI priority group uptake
  figures.\r\n\r\nThis means all the JCVI cohorts and populations have changed for
  both numerator and denominators on these two dates and care should be taken when
  interpreting trends.\r\n\r\nOn 08 December 2020, a Coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine
  developed by Pfizer BioNTech (Comirnaty) was first used in the UK as part of national
  immunisation programmes. The AstraZeneca (Spikevax) vaccine was also approved for
  use in the national programme, and rollout of this vaccine began on 04 January 2021.
  Moderna (Vaxzevria) vaccine was approved for use on 8 January 2021 and rollout of
  this vaccine began on 07 April 2021.\r\n\r\nThese vaccines have met strict standards
  of safety, quality and effectiveness set out by the independent Medicines and Healthcare
  Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). \r\n\r\nThose giving the vaccine to others were
  the first to receive the vaccination. In the first phase of the programme, NHS Scotland
  followed the independent advice received from the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/948353/Priority_groups_for_coronavirus__COVID-19__vaccination_-_advice_from_the_JCVI__2_December_2020.pdf">Joint
  Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI)</a> and prioritised delivery of
  the vaccine to those with the greatest clinical need, in line with the recommended
  order of prioritisation.  For booster vaccinations a similar approach has been adopted.
  \r\n\r\nDefinitions used in the vaccine uptake by JCVI priority group resource can
  be found in the <a href="https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/covid-19-vaccination-in-scotland/resource/29e8ab8e-065a-4f92-ab70-4371d757633b">JCVI
  Priority Group Definitions table</a>. Individuals can appear in more than one JCVI
  priority group.\r\n\r\nThis dataset provides information on daily number of COVID
  vaccinations in Scotland. Data on the total number of vaccinations in Scotland is
  presented by day administered and vaccine type, by age group, by sex, by non-age
  cohorts and by geographies (NHS Board and Local Authority). As the population in
  the cohorts can change with time, these will be refined when updated data are available.\r\n\r\nAdditional
