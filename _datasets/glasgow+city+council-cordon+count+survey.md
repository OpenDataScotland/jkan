notes: "<p>Glasgow City Council has undertaken annual surveys since 2007 to evaluate\
  \ the number of pedestrians and cyclists entering and leaving the city as part of\
  \ the annual monitoring of active travel patterns. The data presented here are from\
  \ 2009 onwards.  A total of 35 sites form a cordon around the centre of the city\
  \ and are monitored between 6:00am and 8:00pm over two successive days each September.\
  \ All pedestrian and cycle movement at these locations, to and from the city, are\
  \ counted.<div><p>The City Centre Cordon Count was undertaken annually between 2009\
  \ and 2018. The frequency changed to every 3 years due to the availability of the\
  \ data produced by the suite of automatic cycle counters. The first count in the\
  \ new schedule was programmed for 2021 however, a supplementary count was undertaken\
  \ in 2020 to measure the effects of the global pandemic on active travel within\
  \ the city cordon.\_</p><br /></div></p>"
