notes: '<p>Scottish councils usually divide towns and country areas into catchments
  and children living in a catchment area will usually go to the same local school.
  Domestic properties typically have a catchment area for each of their local: - primary
  non-denominational (PN),  - secondary non-denominational (SN),  - primary denominational/
  Catholic (PD) and  - secondary denominational/ Catholic (SN) schools.  This dataset
  contains four separate layers (representing those above categories), which we deliver
  together as one single web service or zip folder.  These data layers do not contain
  the catchment areas for Jordanhill primary and secondary school which is located
  in west Glasgow. This is because it is a Scottish Government-funded school.</p>'
