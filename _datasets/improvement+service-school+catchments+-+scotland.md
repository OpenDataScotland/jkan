notes: '<p>Scottish local authorities usually divide towns and country areas into
  catchments and children living in a catchment area will usually go to the same local
  school. Domestic properties typically have a catchment area for each of their local:
  - primary non-denominational (PN),  - secondary non-denominational (SN),  - primary
  denominational / Catholic (PD) and  - secondary denominational / Catholic (SD) schools.  This
  dataset contains four separate layers (representing those above categories), which
  we deliver together as one single web service or zip folder.  These data layers
  do not contain the catchment areas for Jordanhill primary and secondary school which
  is located in west Glasgow. This is because it is a Scottish Government-funded school.</p>'
