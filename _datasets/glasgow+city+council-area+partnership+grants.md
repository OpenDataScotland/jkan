notes: "<div>All 23 Area Partnerships in Glasgow are allocated an area budget each\
  \ year which they use to provide grants to mainly local community and voluntary\
  \ organisations, to help those organisations achieve local priorities set by each\
  \ Partnership. Financial support can also be awarded to support Council Services\
  \ and other partner organisations if the application demonstrates a fit with local\
  \ priorities, the involvement of local people, and additional benefits.The total\
  \ budget available from the 23 Area Partnerships for 2021/22 amounts to \xA31,864,968,\
  \ with varying allocations to individual Area Partnerships. Grant applications are\
  \ invited at any time, with grants under \xA3500 awarded on a regular basis, and\
  \ larger awards decided at Area Partnership meetings (normally four times per year,\
  \ maximum limits apply).</div>\n<div><br /></div>"
