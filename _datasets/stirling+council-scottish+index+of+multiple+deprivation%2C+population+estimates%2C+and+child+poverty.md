  \ Deprivation 2020 is the Scottish Government\u2019s official tool for identifying\
  \ those places in Scotland suffering from deprivation. It incorporates several different\
  \ aspects of deprivation (employment, income, health, education, skills and training,\
  \ geographic access, crime and housing), combining them into a single index.</span></font></div><div><font\

  \ style='font-size:14px;'>The 2020 Index provides a relative ranking for small areas\
  \ in Scotland, defined by the Scottish Neighbourhood Statistics (SNS) Data Zone\
  \ 2011 geography, from 1 (most deprived) to 6,976 (least deprived). By identifying\
  \ small areas where there are concentrations of multiple deprivation, the SIMD can\
  \ be used to target policies and resources at the places with greatest need. The\
  \ SIMD also provides a rank for each data zone within each of the seven domains,\
  \ and therefore it is possible to look at individual aspects of deprivation for\
  \ each area, as well as the overall level of deprivation.</span></font></div></div><div><font\
