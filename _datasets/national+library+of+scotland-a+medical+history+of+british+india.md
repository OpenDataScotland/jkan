notes: "<p>Trial the data: This dataset forms the first half of the Medical History\
  \ of British India collection, which itself is part of the broader India Papers\
  \ collection held by the Library. A Medical History of British India consists of\
  \ official publications varying from short reports to multi-volume histories related\
  \ to disease, public health and medical research between circa 1850 to 1950.\_These\
  \ are historical sources for a period which witnessed the transition from a humoral\
  \ to a biochemical tradition, which was based on laboratorial science and document\
  \ the important breakthroughs in bacteriology, parasitology and the developments\
  \ of vaccines in a colonial context. The vivid detail in these reports that makes\
  \ them a treasure-trove of regional histories, including the effect of diseases\
  \ on the social fabric of small villages and towns.\_The accompanying detailed topographical\
  \ maps and extensive statistics also provide valuable data. In addition, they reveal\
  \ the development of surveillance systems and the official response to epidemic\
  \ emergencies within a colonial context, providing vital insights into the role\
  \ of government and the operation of colonial power. Many of the breakthroughs and\
  \ advances in the treatment and prevention of communicable diseases are represented\
  \ in the collection, and a number of the titles are either about or by prominent\
  \ figures in the field (for example, Sir Ronald Ross, W M Haffkine and S R Christophers).\
  \ They also provide names of individuals attending medical schools, hospitals, the\
  \ Indian civil service and other institutions. Visit the Library\u2019s website\
  \ for the collection: A Medical History of British India website</p>"
