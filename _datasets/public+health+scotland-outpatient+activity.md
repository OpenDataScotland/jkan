notes: <p>Patients who require the medical opinion of a specialist clinician may be
  referred to an outpatient clinic for treatment or investigation. An outpatient is
  a patient who attends a consultant or other medical clinic or has an arranged meeting
  with a consultant or a senior member of their team outside of a clinic session.
  Outpatients are not admitted to a hospital and do not use a hospital bed.\r\n\r\nOutpatient
  attendances can be categorised as new or follow-up (return) attendances. Information
  on return appointments is only available for datasets that report on NHS board of
  treatment. Files reporting on the residency of patients only contain data for new
  outpatients as the ISD(S)1 data source for return outpatients does not contain residence
  information. ISD(S)1 also does not record information on the deprivation, age or
  sex of patients.\r\n\r\nAll publications and supporting material to this topic area
