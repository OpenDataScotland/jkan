notes: "<p>The Roll of Honour for the <strong>Great War</strong> (later known as World\
  \ War I or WWI) was compiled by the City Assessor, Mr H. G. Pope.  In early 1925,\
  \ forms were sent to each householder in Aberdeen asking for full details of those\
  \ relatives who had fallen during the conflict.  For military personnel, the details\
  \ included rank, regiment and any military honours.  The forms also requested details\
  \ of any non-combatants killed by enemy action and those in the <strong>Mercantile\
  \ Marine</strong> (Merchant Navy - commercial/civilian vessels and crews that were\
  \ engaged in activity supporting the Nation during times of war or those requisitioned\
  \ and reassigned to military duties, such as minesweeping). The WWI Roll also drew\
  \ together many separate lists provided by Churches, the University of Aberdeen,\
  \ schools, guilds and businesses. The City Assessor was responsible for ensuring\
  \ that no duplications existed. The final copy of the Roll contained over five thousand\
  \ names.   </p>\n<p>Later, two dedicated volumes were created to commemorate lives\
  \ lost during <strong>World War II</strong>. Volume One: <strong>HM Forces and the\
  \ Merchant Navy</strong> and Volume Two: <strong>Civil Defence and Civilians</strong>.\
  \ The separate volumes record slightly different information.    </p>\n<p>The <strong>Post-1945</strong>\
  \ Roll varies in intent from the WWI and WWII volumes. This volume is hand-written,\
  \ and records HM Forces lives lost in conflict and during active service, so includes\
  \ those who lost their lives in Northern Ireland, for example.    </p>\n<p>The transcripts\
  \ are an attempt to provide a structure to the data recorded in the City\u2019s\
  \ Rolls of Honour. Original copies of the WWI volume can be accessed in the Central\
  \ Library, Aberdeen Art Gallery, and the Aberdeen City Archives. The WWII and Post-1945\
  \ volumes can be viewed in Aberdeen Art Gallery (McBey library on Level 1).  Links\
