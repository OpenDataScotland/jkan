notes: "<p>This dataset identifies Forest Plans approved during the Scottish Forestry\
  \ Grant Scheme 2003-2006.\_ Forest Plans aim to deliver long-term environmental\
  \ benefits through sustainable forest management and consists of a strategic plan\
  \ over a 20 year period.  Forest Plans were introduced for landowners planning to\
  \ carry out felling, restocking and thinning in their woodlands.    Forestry Commission\
  \ Scotland provided a grant to help prepare a plan (Plan Preparation Grant) and\
  \ owners could claim restocking grants set at the same rate as the Woodland Grant\
  \ Scheme (1999 - 2003) or Scottish Forestry Grant Scheme (2003 - 2006).    Once\
  \ the plan was approved, a Forest Plan contract provided felling and restocking\
  \ approval for 10 years.    Forest Plans (SFGS) were closed to new applications\
  \ in December 2006.    For more detailed information please see the metadata record\
  \ on Scotland's SpatialData.gov.scot Metadata Portal.</p>"
