notes: '<p>Confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been identified by a positive SARS-CoV-2
  viral PCR test result.\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nFor any individual, the specimen date of their
  first positive viral PCR result is taken as the date of onset of their first episode
  of COVID-19.\t\t\r\nSubsequent positive viral PCR results with specimen date within
  90 days of their first positive result are discounted.\t\t\r\nIf the individual
  then has a positive viral PCR result with specimen date \u226590 days after their
  first positive result, this is taken as the date of onset of their second episode
  of COVID-19.\t\t\r\nSubsequent positive viral PCR results with specimen date within
  90 days of this second index date are then discounted as for the first episode of
  COVID, and so on.\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nConfirmed cases of COVID-19 have been identified
  as occurring in pregnancy if the date of onset of the episode of COVID-19 occurred
  at any point from the estimated date of conception (date the woman was 2+0 weeks
  gestation) up to and including the date the pregnancy ended. \t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nTraditionally,
  pregnancies were dated from the first day of a woman''s last menstrual period (LMP)
  prior to her pregnancy, with this date being set as the first day of gestation (0+0
  weeks) and babies being ''due'' at 40+0 weeks.\t\t\r\nConception, and hence the
  actual start of the pregnancy, usually occurs around 2 weeks after the first day
  of the LMP, at 2+0 gestation.\t\t\r\nThese days, pregnancies are usually dated based
  on an ultrasound scan done in early pregnancy and the woman''s LMP date, but this
  dating convention is still used, i.e. the date of conception is set at 2+0 weeks
  gestation.\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nBroadly the three trimesters of pregnancy divide pregnancies
  into three approximately equal time periods covering early, mid, and later pregnancy\t\t\r\nHowever,
  there is no internationally agreed definition of the exact start and end point of
  each trimester\t\t\r\nHere we have used the definitions recommended by the American
  College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists\t\t\r\nhttps://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2017/05/methods-for-estimating-the-due-date\t\t\r\nThe
  most critical period for a baby''s development is between 2+0 and 9+6 weeks gestation:
  this is the period when all the major organs in the body are formed\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nAs
  the testing data is more up to date than the pregnancy data, we have assumed that
  any woman showing as 44+0 weeks gestation or over at the date of onset of an episode
  of COVID-19 was in fact no longer pregnant at that time and this has not been counted
  as an infection in pregnancy.\t\t\r\nAs described in the Data sources tab, these
  data lag issues will be resolved over time as pregnancy related records are returned
  to PHS and incorporated into the COPS study database of pregnant women.\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nThe
  COPS study database includes women aged 11 to 55 years inclusive at the time of
  conception.  \t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nAn unlinked analysis has been used to calculate rates
  of infection among pregnant women.\t\t\r\nThe denominator for this analysis is a
  ''snapshot'' of the number of women pregnant at the start of the specified month.\t\t\r\nThe
  numerator is the number of women with onset of COVID-19 during pregnancy at any
  point during the specified month.\t\t\r\n</p>'
