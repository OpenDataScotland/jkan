notes: <p>This release presents data on quit attempts made with the help of NHS stop
  smoking services during the financial years, 2009/10 \u2013 2019/20, and the outcomes
  of those quit attempts. Information is presented at national, NHS Board and Local
  Authority level along with breakdowns including age, gender, and deprivation. Statistics
  are based on total \u2018quit attempts\u2019 made during the year, rather than total
  number of clients with a quit attempt, so could include repeat quit attempts for
  the same client. \r\n\r\nAll publications and supporting material to this topic
