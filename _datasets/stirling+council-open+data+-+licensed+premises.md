  <div>License Boards, established by Local Authorities, manage alcohol and public
  entertainment licenses, make decisions on applications, review appeals, and set
  local policies. Civic Licenses for activities like street trading and late-night
  refreshment are also administered to ensure standards and regulations are met, safeguarding
  public welfare. Additionally, Local Authorities regulate taxi services, ensuring
  driver competence and vehicle safety. This comprehensive oversight maintains public
  safety and upholds standards across licensed activities in Scotland.</div>'
