notes: '<p>A Building Standards Register is maintained by local authorities under
  the terms of Section 24 of the Building (Scotland) Act 2003. Local authorities are
  responsible for granting permission for work to be done (building warrant) and for
  a completed building to be occupied (completion certificate). These registers are
  online and searchable and published as weekly lists in a similar way to planning
  applications.</p>

  <p>Registers typically contain details of applications at the following stages of
  the building warrant process:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>Received</li>

  <li>Decided</li>

  <li>Commenced</li>

  <li>Completed</li>

  </ul>

  <p>We strongly recommend that, when using the WFS for this dataset, because of it''s
  size you should use it with a filter.  For example with the attributes ''local_authority''
  and ''year''.</p>'
