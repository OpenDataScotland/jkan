notes: "<p>Scottish councils usually divide towns and country areas into catchments\
  \ and children living in a catchment area will usually go to the same local school.\
  \ Domestic properties typically have a catchment area for each of their local:\n\
  \ - primary non-denominational (PN), \n - secondary non-denominational (SN), \n\
  \ - primary denominational/ Catholic (PD) and \n - secondary denominational/ Catholic\
  \ (SN) schools.</p>\n<p>This dataset contains four separate layers (representing\
  \ those above categories), which we deliver together as one single web service or\
  \ zip folder.  </p>\n<p>\"name\" and \"seed_code\" are now MANDATORY fields for\
