notes: "<p>Trial the data: The first eight editions of Encyclopaedia Britannica, issued\
  \ from 1768-1860, comprise a total of 143 volumes. The Britannica was first issued\
  \ in Edinburgh in 100 weekly parts (forming 3 volumes) from 1768 to 1771 and illustrated\
  \ with 160 copperplate engravings. The enterprise was undertaken by the partnership\
  \ of printer Colin Macfarquhar (1744-1793) and engraver Andrew Bell (1726-1809)\
  \ who paid William Smellie (1740-1795) to compile the Britannica\u2019s first edition\
  \ for a fee of \xA3200. Subsequent editions of the Britannica expanded the content:\
  \ the second edition was published in 10 volumes (1777-1784); the third in 18 volumes\
  \ (1788-1797). As the Britannica expanded it sought contributions from leading experts\
  \ in their fields who were either approached by the editors or drawn by the encyclopaedia\u2019\
  s growing reputation. Macfarquhar and Bell retained the copyright for the first\
  \ three editions before publication was taken over by Archibald Constable and then\
  \ A &amp; C Black. Managed and published in Edinburgh up to the 9th edition. The\
  \ Britannica set the standard for modern encyclopedias and is sometimes seen as\
  \ an enduring product of the Scottish Enlightenment. These volumes were a compendium\
  \ of current and practical knowledge made relatively affordable by the initial efforts\
  \ of Macfarquhar and Bell and by Smellie\u2019s views on the democratisation of\
  \ knowledge and the axiom, with which he opens the Preface to the first edition,\
  \ that \u201Cutility ought to be the principal intention of every publication.\u201D\
