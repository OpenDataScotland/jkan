notes: "<p>The Scottish Forestry Grant Scheme (SFGS) - encouraged the creation and\
  \ management of woods and forests to provide economic, environmental and social\
  \ benefits.\_ This dataset identifies scheme boundary areas from SFGS.  Following\
  \ publication of the Scottish Executive\u2019s Scottish Forestry Strategy 'Forests\
  \ for Scotland' the opportunity was taken to review the Woodland Grant Scheme and\
  \ the Farm Woodland Premium Scheme and give them a greater Scottish focus.     The\
  \ Scottish Forestry Grant Scheme (SFGS) - encouraged the creation and management\
  \ of woods and forests to provide economic, environmental and social benefits. \
  \   Grants were available under three main areas:    Grants for woodland expansion\
  \ - creating new woodlands. Restocking grants, for replanting following felling.\
  \ Stewardship grants, for a range of activities in existing woodlands.    Applications\
  \ for SFGS grants started in June 2003 and closed in August 2006.    Most grants\
  \ for SFGS were based on a percentage of Standard Costs of agreed operations. The\
  \ Standard Cost took account of the costs of labour, plants, machinery, materials\
  \ and supervision to do work to the specification as set out in the SFGS Standard\
  \ Costs and Specifications Booklet.    Depending upon the level of public benefit,\
  \ grant payments were either at 60% or 90% of the Standard Cost. In the case of\
  \ restocking, Standard Costs were mostly pitched at 75% of the new planting Standard\
  \ Costs.    Grants were available for planting proposals that met one or more of\
  \ the following objectives:    Establishing well-designed productive woodland. Expanding\
  \ areas of native woodland, preferably through natural regeneration and the development\
  \ of Forest Habitat Networks. Improving riparian habitat. Improving the quality\
  \ and setting of urban or post-industrial areas. Improving the diversity of the\
  \ farmed and crofting landscape.    Details of all eligible operations are set out\
  \ within the 'Applicants Booklet' available from Conservancy Offices.    SFGS OBJECTIVES\
  \  The abbreviations below list the SFGS objectives proposals are designed to meet:\
  \    Establishment grants     P1 to establish well-designed productive forest P2\
  \ to expand the area of native woodland P3 to improve a riparian habitat P4 to improve\
  \ the quality and setting of urban or post-industrial areas P5 to improve the diversity\
  \ of the farmed/crofting landscape    Stewardship Grants     S1 to improve timber\
  \ quality S2 to reduce deer numbers S3 to improve the ecological value of native\
  \ woodlands S4 to improve woodland biodiversity S5 to enhance landscape value S6\
  \ to develop alternative systems to clear-felling S7 to develop woodland recreation\
  \ S8 to develop community involvement    Restocking grants     R1 to produce well\
  \ designed productive forest R2 to restore areas of native woodland R3 to improve\
  \ riparian habitat R4 to improve the quality and setting of urban or post-industrial\
  \ areas R5 to improve the diversity of the farmed/crofting landscape    Felling\
  \     F1 Clear felling F2 Selective felling F3 Continuous Cover F4 Thinning    Other\
  \ land     OL is not grant aided    SPATIAL DATA  There are four spatial datasets\
  \ associated with SFGS. These represent the scheme boundaries, management plan boundaries,\
  \ sub-compartment boundaries and deer fence lines within each approved SFGS scheme.\
  \     Each SFGS spatial dataset is accompanied by a specific non-spatial database\
  \ table. The datasets can be related to each other on a 'many to one' basis. This\
  \ reflects the fact that many SFGS operations may occur within one spatial geography\
  \ (eg.a sub-compartment).    The S_SFGS_SCHEME_BDY spatial dataset can be 'related'\
  \ to the S_LINK_SFGS_OPSSCHEME table using the 'SchemeNo' attribute field.     S_SFGS_SCHEME_BDY\
