notes: "<p>Place Profiles have been prepared to help people understand how Planning\
  \ relates to the places where people live, work and spend their time.</p>\n<p>Based\
  \ on the development planning themes of sustainability, liveability and productivity,\
  \ they tell a story about the environmental, social and economic characteristics\
  \ of each community council area.  </p>\n<p>They have been created to help people\
  \ engage in the preparation of Stirling\u2019s next Local Development Plan (LDP3),\
  \ and with the planning system more generally. </p>\n<p>They have also been produced\
  \ to assist communities in preparing Local Place Plans.  </p>\n<p>Place Profiles\
  \ for all community council areas covered by the Stirling Local Development Plan\
  \ will be published in spring 2024.</p>\n<p>______________________________</p>\n\
