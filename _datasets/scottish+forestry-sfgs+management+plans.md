notes: "<p>The Scottish Forestry Grant Scheme (SFGS) - encouraged the creation and\
  \ management of woods and forests to provide economic, environmental and social\
  \ benefits.\_ This dataset identifies management plan areas from SFGS.  Following\
  \ publication of the Scottish Executive\u2019s Scottish Forestry Strategy 'Forests\
  \ for Scotland' the opportunity was taken to review the Woodland Grant Scheme and\
  \ the Farm Woodland Premium Scheme and give them a greater Scottish focus.     The\
  \ Scottish Forestry Grant Scheme (SFGS) - encouraged the creation and management\
  \ of woods and forests to provide economic, environmental and social benefits. \
  \   Grants were available under three main areas:    Grants for woodland expansion\
  \ - creating new woodlands.Restocking grants, for replanting following felling.Stewardship\
  \ grants, for a range of activities in existing woodlands.    Applications for SFGS\
  \ grants started in June 2003 and closed in August 2006.     Most grants for SFGS\
  \ were based on a percentage of Standard Costs of agreed operations. The Standard\
  \ Cost took account of the costs of labour, plants, machinery, materials and supervision\
  \ to do work to the specification as set out in the SFGS Standard Costs and Specifications\
  \ Booklet.    Depending upon the level of public benefit, grant payments were either\
  \ at 60% or 90% of the Standard Cost. In the case of restocking, Standard Costs\
  \ were mostly pitched at 75% of the new planting Standard Costs.    Grants were\
  \ available for planting proposals that met one or more of the following objectives:\
  \    Establishing well-designed productive woodland.Expanding areas of native woodland,\
  \ preferably through natural regeneration and the development of Forest Habitat\
  \ Networks.Improving riparian habitat.Improving the quality and setting of urban\
  \ or post-industrial areas.Improving the diversity of the farmed and crofting landscape.\
  \    Details of all eligible operations are set out within the 'Applicants Booklet'\
  \ available from Conservancy Offices.    SFGS OBJECTIVES  The abbreviations below\
  \ list the SFGS objectives proposals are designed to meet:    Establishment grants\

  \ DATA  There are four spatial datasets associated with SFGS. These represent the\
  \ scheme boundary, management plan boundaries, sub-compartment boundaries and deer\
  \ fence lines within each approved SFGS scheme.     The spatial datasets are related\
  \ to the GLS database on a 'many to one' basis. This reflects the fact that many\
  \ operations may occur within one sub-compartment.    Data is captured against OS\
  \ Mastermap.    Management Plan Operation References    200 - Reducing deer numbers300\

  \ - Monitoring    Each SFGS spatial dataset is accompanied by a specific non-spatial\
  \ database table. The datasets can be related to each other on a 'many to one' basis.\
  \ This reflects the fact that many SFGS operations may occur within one spatial\
  \ geography (eg.a sub-compartment).    The S_SFGS_MAN_PLAN spatial dataset can be\
  \ 'related' to the S_LINK_SFGS_OPSMANPLAN table using the 'SC_Link' attribute field.\
