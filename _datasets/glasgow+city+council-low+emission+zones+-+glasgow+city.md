notes: <p>Low Emissions Zone Boundary. A Low Emission Zone is an area where a person
  may not drive a vehicle which does not meet a specified emission standard. LEZs
  are intended to reduce pollution levels and improve air quality in areas where standards
  are not being met. LEZs are based on a penalty notice approach to effectively ban
  non-compliant vehicles.</p>
