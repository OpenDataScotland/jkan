notes: <p>Low Emissions Zone Boundary for Glasgow City Council. A Low Emission Zone
  is an area where a person may not drive a vehicle which does not meet a specified
  emission standard. LEZs are intended to reduce pollution levels and improve air
  quality in areas where standards are not being met. LEZs are based on a penalty
  notice approach to effectively ban non-compliant vehicles.</p>
