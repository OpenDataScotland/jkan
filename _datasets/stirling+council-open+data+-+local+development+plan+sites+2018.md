notes: "<p><b>This dataset is published as Open Data.</b><div><br /></div><div><div>Please\
  \ also note the dataset contains a number of duplicated polygons that share the\
  \ same geometries but different values. This dataset should therefore be used with\
  \ these caveats in mind.<br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Development plans set\
  \ out the long term vision for where development should and shouldn\u2019t happen\
  \ in the places they cover. The local development plan is the principal land use\
  \ planning document used in assessing applications for planning permission, based\
  \ upon national, regional and local policies and proposals. It is the most significant\
  \ material consideration in determining such applications and reference to the local\
  \ development plan is essential for most types of proposed development. The main\
  \ spatial element is typically the policies and proposals map, which is created\
  \ from the data that is also used in this dataset. Some policies will be plan-wide,\
  \ and not reproduced spatially, so this dataset contains policy data that is linked\
  \ to a discrete area within the planning authority area.</div><div><br /></div><div>Update\
  \ and reference to other datasets</div><div><br /></div><div>This dataset will be\
  \ updated as and when development plans are replaced and formally adopted by authorities,\
  \ on a minimum quarterly basis in operational terms each year. Local development\
  \ plans are currently replaced on a five year basis and will be further modified\
  \ by the forthcoming Planning Act, likely moving to a ten year cycle with interim\
  \ updates, although it is not yet clear on how updates will be prepared.</div><div><br\
  \ /></div><div>This dataset should be used in conjunction with other planning related\
  \ datasets available, notably planning applications, conservation areas, housing\
  \ land and employment land. There may be some duplication with related layers, due\
  \ to the ways that particular authorities may share data, and this will be resolved\
  \ on a layer-by-layer basis as this dataset (and others) are developed. This is\
  \ also true for some national datasets, such as statutory designations for natural\
  \ heritage: these typically originate with other agencies although they are often\
  \ published as part of a local development plan. This will also be resolved, in\
  \ data architecture terms, through dialogue with these key agencies.</div><div><br\
