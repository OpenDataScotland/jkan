notes: "<p>Scottish Planning Policy (SPP) requires that a five-year ongoing effective\
  \ land supply is available to meet the identified housing land requirements. Planning\
  \ authorities therefore carry out regular monitoring of housing completions and\
  \ the progress of sites through the planning process. This is achieved through the\
  \ preparation of a housing land audit, carried out annually by the planning authority\
  \ in conjunction with housing and infrastructure providers.This update provides\
  \ an overview of North Ayrshire\u2019s Housing Land Audit (HLA) figures for the\
  \ period April 2020 to March 2021. It includes details of housing completions for\
  \ the 12 months up to 31st March 2021 and the future delivery programming of all\
  \ housing sites within North Ayrshire.The Housing Land Audit monitors housing sites\
  \ which have a capacity of four or more new houses and identifies and quantifies\
  \ the land available for housing in North Ayrshire.</p>"
