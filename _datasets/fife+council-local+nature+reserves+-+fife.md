notes: "<p>Local Nature Reserves are areas of (at least) locally important natural\
  \ heritage, designated and managed by local authorities to give people better opportunities\
  \ to learn about and enjoy nature close to where they live. They are found across\
  \ the country, but generally close to towns and cities.\n More details are available\
