notes: '<p>This dataset provides information on number of new daily confirmed cases,
  negative cases, deaths, testing by NHS Labs (Pillar 1) and UK Government (Pillar
  2), new hospital admissions, new ICU admissions, hospital and ICU bed occupancy
  from novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in Scotland, including cumulative totals and population
  rates at Scotland, NHS Board and Council Area levels (where possible). Seven day
  positive cases and population rates are also presented by Neighbourhood Area (Intermediate
  Zone 2011). Information on how PHS publish small are COVID figures is available
  on the\u202f<a href="https://publichealthscotland.scot/our-areas-of-work/covid-19/covid-19-data-and-intelligence/covid-19-daily-cases-in-scotland-dashboard/how-we-publish-small-area-covid-figures/">PHS
  website</a>. \r\n\r\nNovel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new strain of coronavirus
  first identified in Wuhan, China. Clinical presentation may range from mild-to-moderate
  illness to pneumonia or severe acute respiratory infection. COVID-19 was declared
  a pandemic by the World Health Organisation on 12 March 2020. We now have spread
  of COVID-19 within communities in the UK. \r\n\r\n \r\nPublic Health Scotland no
  longer reports the number of COVID-19 deaths within 28 days of a first positive
  test from 2nd June 2022. Please refer to\u202f<a href="https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/vital-events/general-publications/weekly-and-monthly-data-on-births-and-deaths/deaths-involving-coronavirus-covid-19-in-scotland">NRS
  death certificate data</a>\u202fas the single source for COVID-19 deaths data in
  Scotland. \r\n \r\nTo allow new data to be fully processed and available at 12:00
  on a Wednesday, the Daily COVID-19 in Scotland and COVID-19 Vaccination in Scotland
  datasets will be temporarily unavailable from 11:00 to 12:00. During this window,
  the datasets will not be visible and any queries made to these datasets will return
  a 404 \u2013 Not found error. At all other times the datasets will be available
  in full as usual. \r\n\r\nIn the process of updating the hospital admissions reporting
  to include reinfections, we have had to review existing methodology. In order to
  provide the best possible linkage of COVID-19 cases to hospital admissions, each
  admission record is required to have a discharge date, to allow us to better match
  the most appropriate COVID positive episode details to an admission. This means
  that in cases where the discharge date is missing (either due to the patient still
  being treated, delays in discharge information being submitted or data quality issues),
  it has to be estimated. Estimating a discharge date for historic records means that
  the average stay for those with missing dates is reduced, and fewer stays overlap
  with records of positive tests. \r\n\r\nThe result of these changes has meant that
  approximately 1,200 historic COVID admissions have been removed due to improvements
  in methodology to handle missing discharge dates, while approximately 820 have been
  added to the cumulative total with the inclusion of reinfections. \r\n\r\nCOVID-19
  hospital admissions are now identified as the following: A patient''s first positive
  PCR or LFD test of the episode of infection (including reinfections at 90 days or
  more) for COVID-19 up to 14 days prior to admission to hospital, on the day of their
  admission or during their stay in hospital. If a patient''s first positive PCR or
  LFD test of the episode of infection is after their date of discharge from hospital,
  they are not included in the analysis. \r\n\r\nInformation on COVID-19, including
  stay at home advice for people who are self-isolating and their households, can
  be found on\u202f<a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19#stay-at-home-advice">NHS
