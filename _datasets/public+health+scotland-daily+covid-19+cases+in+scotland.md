notes: "<p>This dataset provides information on number of new daily confirmed cases,\
  \ negative cases, deaths, testing by NHS Labs (Pillar 1) and UK Government (Pillar\
  \ 2), new hospital admissions, new ICU admissions, hospital and ICU bed occupancy\
  \ from novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in Scotland, including cumulative totals and\
  \ population rates at Scotland, NHS Board and Council Area levels (where possible).\
  \ Seven day positive cases and population rates are also presented by Neighbourhood\
  \ Area (Intermediate Zone 2011). Information on how PHS publish small are COVID\
  \ figures is available on the\u202F<a href=\"https://publichealthscotland.scot/our-areas-of-work/covid-19/covid-19-data-and-intelligence/covid-19-daily-cases-in-scotland-dashboard/how-we-publish-small-area-covid-figures/\"\
  >PHS website</a>. </p>\n<p>Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new strain of coronavirus\
  \ first identified in Wuhan, China. Clinical presentation may range from mild-to-moderate\
  \ illness to pneumonia or severe acute respiratory infection. COVID-19 was declared\
  \ a pandemic by the World Health Organisation on 12 March 2020. We now have spread\
  \ of COVID-19 within communities in the UK. </p>\n<p>Public Health Scotland no longer\
  \ reports the number of COVID-19 deaths within 28 days of a first positive test\
  \ from 2nd June 2022. Please refer to\u202F<a href=\"https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/vital-events/general-publications/weekly-and-monthly-data-on-births-and-deaths/deaths-involving-coronavirus-covid-19-in-scotland\"\
  >NRS death certificate data</a>\u202Fas the single source for COVID-19 deaths data\
  \ in Scotland. </p>\n<p>To allow new data to be fully processed and available at\
  \ 12:00 on a Wednesday, the Daily COVID-19 in Scotland and COVID-19 Vaccination\
  \ in Scotland datasets will be temporarily unavailable from 11:00 to 12:00. During\
  \ this window, the datasets will not be visible and any queries made to these datasets\
  \ will return a 404 \u2013 Not found error. At all other times the datasets will\
  \ be available in full as usual. </p>\n<p>In the process of updating the hospital\
  \ admissions reporting to include reinfections, we have had to review existing methodology.\
  \ In order to provide the best possible linkage of COVID-19 cases to hospital admissions,\
  \ each admission record is required to have a discharge date, to allow us to better\
  \ match the most appropriate COVID positive episode details to an admission. This\
  \ means that in cases where the discharge date is missing (either due to the patient\
  \ still being treated, delays in discharge information being submitted or data quality\
  \ issues), it has to be estimated. Estimating a discharge date for historic records\
  \ means that the average stay for those with missing dates is reduced, and fewer\
  \ stays overlap with records of positive tests. </p>\n<p>The result of these changes\
  \ has meant that approximately 1,200 historic COVID admissions have been removed\
  \ due to improvements in methodology to handle missing discharge dates, while approximately\
  \ 820 have been added to the cumulative total with the inclusion of reinfections.\
  \ </p>\n<p>COVID-19 hospital admissions are now identified as the following: A patient's\
  \ first positive PCR or LFD test of the episode of infection (including reinfections\
  \ at 90 days or more) for COVID-19 up to 14 days prior to admission to hospital,\
  \ on the day of their admission or during their stay in hospital. If a patient's\
  \ first positive PCR or LFD test of the episode of infection is after their date\
  \ of discharge from hospital, they are not included in the analysis. </p>\n<p>Information\
  \ on COVID-19, including stay at home advice for people who are self-isolating and\
  \ their households, can be found on\u202F<a href=\"https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19#stay-at-home-advice\"\
