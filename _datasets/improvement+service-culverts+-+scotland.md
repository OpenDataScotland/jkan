notes: "<p>Scottish legislation\_(Section 17) of the Flood Risk Management (Scotland)\
  \ Act 2009 dictates that records of culverts must be created and maintained. Specifically:\
  \  (1)\_Every local authority must prepare a map which shows (or more than one map\
  \ which, taken together, show) relevant bodies of water and sustainable urban drainage\
  \ systems in its area.   (2) Each map must -         (a) be prepared by such date\
  \ as the Scottish Ministers may direct,         (b) be prepared at a scale that\
  \ the authority considers most appropriate, and         (c) contain such information\
  \ and be in such form as the Scottish Ministers may              specify in regulations.\
  \   (3) A local authority must, from time to time, review and where appropriate\
  \ update the map (or maps) prepared for its area under subsection (1).   (4) A local\
  \ authority must make available for public inspection the map (or maps) prepared\
  \ under this section for the time being applicable to its area.   (5) In this section\
  \ and section 18 - \u201Crelevant body of water\u201D -         (a) means -    \
  \            (i) a body of surface water other than a stretch of coastal water,\
  \ or                (ii) a body of underground water forming part of a watercourse\
  \ (but not                     including a watercourse which is wholly underground),\
  \ but         (b) does not include sewers and drains which drain into sewers, \u201C\
  sustainable              urban drainage system\u201D has the meaning given in section\
  \ 59(1) of the              Sewerage (Scotland) Act 1968 (c.47).  Most Local Authorities\
  \ have contributed (natural) culvert data to the new OS MasterMap Water Network\
  \ Layer\_either through providing data to the Scottish Government or through the\
  \ James Hutton Institute. As this data is now live, a mechanism for managing/maintaining/updating\
  \ this data needs to be put in place. SCOTS (Society of Chief Officers for Transportation\
  \ in Scotland) have approved\_for this dataset to be managed by the Spatial Hub\
  \ and any amended data can be\_uploaded (and potentially downloaded)\_before being\
  \ shared with OSMA members and the OS.  We have initially created a point and line\
  \ data layer representing the data we have been sent by some LAs. However, we really\
  \ need line data in order for it to be merged into the OS MasterMap Water Network\
  \ Layer data in due course.   The LA \"culverts\" data as included in the OS MasterMap\
  \ Water Network Layer is also available for LAs to download and use as part of this\
  \ dataset</p>"
