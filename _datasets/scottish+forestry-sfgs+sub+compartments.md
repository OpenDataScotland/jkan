notes: "<p>The Scottish Forestry Grant Scheme (SFGS) - encouraged the creation and\
  \ management of woods and forests to provide economic, environmental and social\
  \ benefits.\_ This dataset identifies sub-compartment areas from SFGS.  Following\
  \ publication of the Scottish Executive\u2019s Scottish Forestry Strategy 'Forests\
  \ for Scotland' the opportunity was taken to review the Woodland Grant Scheme and\
  \ the Farm Woodland Premium Scheme and give them a greater Scottish focus.     The\
  \ resulting scheme - the Scottish Forestry Grants Scheme (SFGS) - encouraged the\
  \ creation and management of woods and forests to provide economic, environmental\
  \ and social benefits.    Grants were available under three main areas:    Grants\
  \ for woodland expansion - creating new woodlands.Restocking grants, for replanting\
  \ following felling.Stewardship grants, for a range of activities in existing woodlands.\
  \    Applications for SFGS grants started in June 2003 and closed in August 2006.\
  \    Most grants for SFGS were based on a percentage of Standard Costs of agreed\
  \ operations. The Standard Cost took account of the costs of labour, plants, machinery,\
  \ materials and supervision to do work to the specification as set out in the SFGS\
  \ Standard Costs and Specifications Booklet.    Depending upon the level of public\
  \ benefit, grant payments were either at 60% or 90% of the Standard Cost. In the\
  \ case of restocking, Standard Costs were mostly pitched at 75% of the new planting\
  \ Standard Costs.    Grants were available for planting proposals that met one or\
  \ more of the following objectives:    Establishing well-designed productive woodland.Expanding\
  \ areas of native woodland, preferably through natural regeneration and the development\
  \ of Forest Habitat Networks.Improving riparian habitat.Improving the quality and\
  \ setting of urban or post-industrial areas.Improving the diversity of the farmed\
  \ and crofting landscape.    Details of all eligible operations are set out within\
  \ the 'Applicants Booklet' available from Conservancy Offices.    SFGS OBJECTIVES\

  \ DATA  There are four spatial datasets associated with SFGS. These represent the\
  \ scheme boundaries, management plan boundaries, sub-compartment boundaries and\
  \ deer fence lines within each approved SFGS scheme.     Each SFGS spatial dataset\
  \ is accompanied by a specific non-spatial database table. The datasets can be related\
  \ to each other on a 'many to one' basis. This reflects the fact that many SFGS\
  \ operations may occur within one spatial geography (eg.a sub-compartment).    The\
  \ S_SFGS_SUB_CPT spatial dataset can be 'related' to the S_LINK_SFGS_OPSSUB table\
  \ using the 'SC_Link' attribute field.     S_SFGS_SUB_CPT Spatial Attributes:- \
