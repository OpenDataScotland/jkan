notes: "<p>The Scottish Forestry Grant Scheme (SFGS) - encouraged the creation and\
  \ management of woods and forests to provide economic, environmental and social\
  \ benefits.\_ This dataset identifies sub-compartment areas from SFGS.  Following\
  \ publication of the Scottish Executive\u2019s Scottish Forestry Strategy 'Forests\
  \ for Scotland' the opportunity was taken to review the Woodland Grant Scheme and\
  \ the Farm Woodland Premium Scheme and give them a greater Scottish focus.     The\
  \ resulting scheme - the Scottish Forestry Grants Scheme (SFGS) - encouraged the\
  \ creation and management of woods and forests to provide economic, environmental\
  \ and social benefits.    Grants were available under three main areas:    Grants\
  \ for woodland expansion - creating new woodlands. Restocking grants, for replanting\
  \ following felling. Stewardship grants, for a range of activities in existing woodlands.\
  \    Applications for SFGS grants started in June 2003 and closed in August 2006.\
  \    Most grants for SFGS were based on a percentage of Standard Costs of agreed\
  \ operations. The Standard Cost took account of the costs of labour, plants, machinery,\
  \ materials and supervision to do work to the specification as set out in the SFGS\
  \ Standard Costs and Specifications Booklet.    Depending upon the level of public\
  \ benefit, grant payments were either at 60% or 90% of the Standard Cost. In the\
  \ case of restocking, Standard Costs were mostly pitched at 75% of the new planting\
  \ Standard Costs.    Grants were available for planting proposals that met one or\
  \ more of the following objectives:    Establishing well-designed productive woodland.\
  \ Expanding areas of native woodland, preferably through natural regeneration and\
  \ the development of Forest Habitat Networks. Improving riparian habitat. Improving\
  \ the quality and setting of urban or post-industrial areas. Improving the diversity\
  \ of the farmed and crofting landscape.    Details of all eligible operations are\
  \ set out within the 'Applicants Booklet' available from Conservancy Offices.  \
  \  SFGS OBJECTIVES  The abbreviations below list the SFGS objectives proposals are\
  \ designed to meet:    Establishment grants     P1 to establish well-designed productive\
  \ forest P2 to expand the area of native woodland P3 to improve a riparian habitat\
  \ P4 to improve the quality and setting of urban or post-industrial areas P5 to\
  \ improve the diversity of the farmed/crofting landscape    Stewardship grants \
  \    S1 to improve timber quality S2 to reduce deer numbers S3 to improve the ecological\
  \ value of native woodlands S4 to improve woodland biodiversity S5 to enhance landscape\
  \ value S6 to develop alternative systems to clear-felling S7 to develop woodland\
  \ recreation S8 to develop community involvement    Restocking grants     R1 to\
  \ produce well designed productive forest R2 to restore areas of native woodland\
  \ R3 to improve riparian habitat R4 to improve the quality and setting of urban\
  \ or post-industrial areas R5 to improve the diversity of the farmed/crofting landscape\
  \    Felling     F1 Clear felling F2 Selective felling F3 Continuous Cover F4 Thinning\
  \    Other land     OL is not grant aided    SPATIAL DATA  There are four spatial\
  \ datasets associated with SFGS. These represent the scheme boundaries, management\
  \ plan boundaries, sub-compartment boundaries and deer fence lines within each approved\
  \ SFGS scheme.     Each SFGS spatial dataset is accompanied by a specific non-spatial\
  \ database table. The datasets can be related to each other on a 'many to one' basis.\
  \ This reflects the fact that many SFGS operations may occur within one spatial\
  \ geography (eg.a sub-compartment).    The S_SFGS_SUB_CPT spatial dataset can be\
  \ 'related' to the S_LINK_SFGS_OPSSUB table using the 'SC_Link' attribute field.\
