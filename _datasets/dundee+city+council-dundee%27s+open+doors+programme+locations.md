notes: '<div>A programme inviting people in Dundee communities to meet others and
  enjoy activities in a warm and welcoming environment has been launched in Dundee
  City this winter. Agencies across the city have been working on the Open Doors programme,
  with dozens of different community spaces and activities included so far.</div>

  <div><br /></div>

  <div>An online map has been created to allow citizens to find out what''s happening
  in their local neighbourhood. Venues taking part in the programme include churches
  and community centres, libraries and sports venues. A number of community groups
  are also taking part. Activities on offer range from living room activities (such
  as board games, jigsaws and a cuppa on the couch) and sit-down meals to craft groups,
  sports sessions and much more. All are free or low-cost.</div>

  in the Open Doors Programme including facilities offered, opening times, addresses
  and contact details. An interactive map can also be accessed by using the following
