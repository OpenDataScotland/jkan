notes: <p>A programme inviting people in Dundee communities to meet others and enjoy
  activities in a warm and welcoming environment has been launched in Dundee City
  this winter. Agencies across the city have been working on the Open Doors programme,
  with dozens of different community spaces and activities included so far.\r\n\r\nAn
  online map has been created to allow citizens to find out what's happening in their
  local neighbourhood.\r\nVenues taking part in the programme include churches and
  community centres, libraries and sports venues. A number of community groups are
  also taking part. Activities on offer range from living room activities (such as
  board games, jigsaws and a cuppa on the couch) and sit-down meals to craft groups,
  sports sessions and much more. All are free or low-cost.\r\n\r\nThis dataset contains
  a pdf document which shows details of the venues included in the Open Doors Programme
  including facilities offered, opening times, addresses and contact details. A link
  to the interactive map is also contained in this dataset. \r\n</p>
