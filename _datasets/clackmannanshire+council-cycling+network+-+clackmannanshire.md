notes: <p>Councils collect various datasets to do with their cycle network. These
  may contain cycle lanes (which are parts of roads) or cycle paths (distinct from
  the road network). They may be collected as line or polygon features. We'll accept
  either and work out a way to turn them into a standardised national dataset. Cycle
  parking facilities will be captured in the Street Furniture dataset and should not
  be uploaded here.</p>
