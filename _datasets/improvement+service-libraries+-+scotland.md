notes: <p>Each Local Authority should have a list of libraries within their Council
  area. These may be static i.e. located in one building all of the time, or mobile
  i.e. they are in vehicles that attend a set location on a specific day at a certain
  time. This data may also be collected as part of other datasets (e.g. Council Asset
  Register) though Local Authorities do appear to hold it as a distinct layer.  Further
  information on Libraries in Scotland (inc. non-LA libraries) is available from The
  Scottish Library and Information Council (https://scottishlibraries.org/)</p>
