  Areas are areas of "special architectural or historic interest", the character or
  appearance of which it is desirable to preserve or enhance. Conservation Areas are
  designated by Dundee City Council. Protection is achieved by controlling development
  that affects the character or appearance through the use of Article 4 directions.
  This means that planning permission is required for most types of development and
  alterations to the exterior of a property in a conservation area. Contact the Development
  Quality Team, Planning &amp; Transportation for further details.</p>
