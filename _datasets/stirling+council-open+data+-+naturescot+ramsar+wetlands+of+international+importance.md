  <div>Ramsar sites are classified to meet the UK''s commitments under the Ramsar
  Convention. The UKs ratification also extends to its Overseas Territories and Crown
  Dependencies.</div>

  <div><br /></div>

  <div>Ramsar sites are classified under the Convention on Wetlands of International
  Importance. The mission of the Convention is &quot;the conservation and wise use
  of all wetlands through local and national actions and international cooperation,
  as a contribution towards achieving sustainable development throughout the world&quot;.
  The UK Government signed up to the Convention in 1976.</div>

  <div><br /></div>

  <div>Scotland has 51 Ramsar sites designated as internationally important wetlands,
  covering a total area of about 313,000 hectares.</div>

  <div><br /></div>

  <div>Most Ramsar sites in Scotland are linked to the European site network - either
  as a Special Protection Area (SPA) or Special Area of Conservation (SAC). All are
  underpinned by Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs). These sites may be
  of importance for their wide variety of waterbirds, bogs, lochs, coastal wetlands
  and other water-dependent habitats and species.</div>
