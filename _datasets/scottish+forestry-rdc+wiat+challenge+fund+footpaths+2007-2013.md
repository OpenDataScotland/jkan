notes: <p>The Woodlands In and Around Towns (WIAT) programme provided the focus for
  Forestry Commission Scotland's work on improving quality of life in towns and cities.
  This dataset relates to the second phase of the WIAT programme which started in
  April 2008.    This dataset contains new and upgraded footpaths from approved WIAT
  applications. Additionally there are datasets which show the case boundary and car
  parks for WIAT applications.    Additional information on WIAT can be found in the
  overall WIAT boundary dataset metadata which gives details on eligibility criteria
  and further details on the overall programme.    For more detailed information please
  see the metadata record on Scotland's SpatialData.gov.scot Metadata Portal.</p>
