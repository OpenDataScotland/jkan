notes: <p>The Renfrewshire Core Path Plan 2022 outlines the network of key access
  routes across Renfrewshire.  The network of Core Paths identified in the Plan reflect
  key routes which aim to Connect communities, settlements and places of interest;Provide
  opportunities for active travel, particularly to schools and places of work;Connect
  people with nature, areas of greenspace and the wider countryside; andPromote and
  encourage healthy lifestyles.This is the second Core Paths Plan for Renfrewshire
  and replaces the Core Paths Plan adopted in 2009.The network provides a series of
  routes for people of all abilities. Not every route is suitable for everyone and
  the Plan provides information which helps to inform path users on the characteristics
  of each route.The plan reflects the requirements of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act
  2003 in providing an up to date network of core routes which reflect current circumstances.</p>
