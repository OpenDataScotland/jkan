notes: "<p>The Scottish Public Health Observatory (ScotPHO) which is led by Public\
  \ Health Scotland produce estimated life expectancy figures at birth for females\
  \ and males expressed as a five-year average for each Intermediate Zone in Scotland.\
  \ The ScotPHO website contains a range of health statistics and can be accessed\
  \ by clicking on the following link:</p>\n<p>https://www.scotpho.org.uk/</p>\n<p>The\
  \ Scottish Government define an Intermediate Zone as a statistical geography that\
  \ sits between Data Zones and council areas. Intermediate Zones are often used for\
  \ the dissemination of statistics that are not suitable for release at Data Zone\
  \ level because of the sensitive nature of the statistic, or for reasons of reliability.\
  \ Intermediate Zones were designed to meet constraints on population thresholds\
  \ (2,500 - 6,000 household residents), to nest within council areas, and to be built\
  \ up from aggregates of Data Zones. Intermediate Zones also represent a relatively\
  \ stable geography that can be used to analyse change over time, with changes only\
  \ occurring after a Census. The data in this data set is based on the 2011 Intermediate\
  \ zones which splits the whole of Scotland into 1,279 Intermediate Zones of which\
  \ 31 are within Dundee City.</p>\n<p>This dataset is sourced from the ScotPHO website\
  \ and contains the 5-year average life expectancy estimates for females and males\
  \ at birth for each of the Intermediate Zones in Dundee City. Life Expectancy data\
  \ for other areas within Scotland are available on the ScotPHO website and can be\
  \ accessed by using the following link:\n https://scotland.shinyapps.io/ScotPHO_profiles_tool/\n\
