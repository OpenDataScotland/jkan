notes: "<p>Conservation Areas are areas of &quot;special architectural or historic\
  \ interest&quot;, the character or appearance of which it is desirable to preserve\
  \ or enhance.  Conservation Areas are designated by Dundee City Council.  Protection\
  \ is achieved by controlling development that affects the character or appearance\
  \ through the use of Article 4 directions.  This means that planning permission\
  \ is required for most types of development and alterations to the exterior of a\
  \ property in a conservation area. Contact the Development Quality Team, Planning\
  \ &amp; Transportation for further details.<div><br /></div><div>This layer is used\
