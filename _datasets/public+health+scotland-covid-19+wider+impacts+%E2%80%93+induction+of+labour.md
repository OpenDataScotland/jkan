notes: "<p>Care for women around the time they are giving birth is an essential, time\
  \ critical service that cannot be deferred. As such, it has been provided throughout\
  \ the COVID-19 pandemic, and maternity staff have not been redeployed to support\
  \ other services. The way that some elements of this care are provided has changed\
  \ in response to COVID-19 however, to minimise the risk of infection and to allow\
  \ services to continue to provide safe care during times when a high number of staff\
  \ may be off work, for example due to needing to isolate.</p>\n<p>Guidance issued\
  \ by the Scottish Government and Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists\
  \ to maternity services at the height of the first wave of the pandemic noted that:</p>\n\
  <p>\u2022  It may be necessary for services to temporarily suspend the option for\
  \ women to deliver at home or in midwife led units, and to concentrate delivery\
  \ care within obstetric units</p>\n<p>\u2022  Additional restrictions on the use\
  \ of water births were recommended</p>\n<p>\u2022  Care pathways for women requiring\
  \ induction of labour should be amended to ensure the early stages of the induction\
  \ process were delivered on an outpatient basis wherever possible</p>\n<p>\u2022\
  \  Services should consider deferring a planned induction of labour or elective\
  \ caesarean section if a woman was isolating due to having COVID-19, or having been\
  \ in contact with a case, if it was safe to do so</p>\n<p>\u2022  Services should\
  \ support low risk women in the early latent phase of labour to remain at home wherever\
  \ possible</p>\n<p>\u2022  In general, strict restrictions on visitors for patients\
  \ in hospital were advised, however women giving birth could still be accompanied\
  \ by their chosen birth partner</p>\n<p>'Induction of labour' is when a woman is\
  \ given a medical intervention to start her labour rather than waiting for labour\
  \ to start spontaneously. It is offered because there are medical reasons meaning\
  \ it is considered safer (for the mother or baby) for the baby to be born, or because\
  \ a woman is past her \u2018due date\u2019. There are different approaches to inducing\
  \ labour, for example using medicines, a medical \u2018balloon\u2019 device that\
  \ sits at the neck of the womb, and/or breaking the woman\u2019s waters.</p>\n<p>This\
  \ dataset shows information on induction of labour, presented at Scotland and NHS\
  \ Board level. Scotland level data is also available by age group and deprivation\
  \ category. The information on induction of labour presented in this dataset is\
  \ taken from hospital discharge records, specifically records relating to the care\
  \ of women delivering a singleton live birth (i.e. one baby, not twins or more)\
  \ at 37-42 weeks gestation (i.e. up to 3 weeks before or after their due date).</p>\n\
