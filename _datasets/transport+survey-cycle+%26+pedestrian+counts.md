notes: <p><strong>This group details the output from transport monitoring of cyclist
  and pedestrian activity within Stirling.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Outputs from the
  monitors feed into Stirling Council\u2019s </strong><a href="https://www.stirling.gov.uk/roads-transport-streets/environment-friendly-transport/local-transport-strategy-documents/"><strong>Local
  Transport Strategy (LTS)</strong></a><strong>.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Cycle and
  pedestrian data are gathered using cabinets located at the side of footways and
  cycleways, which detect pedestrians using an infra-red beam, and cyclists using
  piezoelectric strips.  The devices used are encrypted, and anonymise any data collected,
  so no pedestrians or cyclists can be traced.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>The movements
  which pass through the detection zone of the counters are classified based on which
  sensors are triggered by the movement.  Where the pedestrian infra-red beam is triggered
  but not the piezo electric strips, the movement is a pedestrian.  Where both the
  infra-red beam and the piezo electric strips are triggered, the movement is a cyclist.  The
  piezo electric strips are installed below the surface of the footway and so when
  cut, will fail to record anything.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>In August 2019, the number
  of locations at which monitors are located increased to 23 with the addition of
  three sites around Craig\u2019s Roundabout. These were installed to allow the figures
  generated from them to be combined with those from the Kerse Road Bridge to provide
  origin-destination data for the network of pathways going through the roundabout.</strong>\r\n\r\n<a
  href="https://trafficscotland.org/"><strong>Traffic Scotland </strong></a> <strong>can
  provide updates on any road closures and the </strong><a href="https://www.roadworksscotland.org/"><strong>Scottish
  Roadworks Commissioner </strong></a><strong>can give further details on any planned
  roadworks throughout the country.</strong>\r\n</p>
