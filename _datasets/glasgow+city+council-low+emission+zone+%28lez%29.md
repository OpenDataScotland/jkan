  \ Low Emission Zone.</div>\n<div>A Low Emission Zone is an area where a person may\
  \ not drive a vehicle which does not meet a specified emission standard. LEZs are\
  \ intended to reduce pollution levels and improve air quality in areas where standards\
  \ are not being met. LEZs are based on a penalty notice approach to effectively\
  \ ban non-compliant vehicles.</div>\n<div>Glasgow's LEZ is being phased in to give\
  \ everyone time to prepare and\_</div>\n<div>from 1 June 2023, phase 2 (all vehicles)\_\
  \ Low Emission Zone (LEZ) will come into force. All vehicles entering the city centre\
  \ zone area will need to meet the less-polluting emission standards or face a penalty\
  \ charge. There are some exemptions and zone residents have extra time to comply.</div>\n\
