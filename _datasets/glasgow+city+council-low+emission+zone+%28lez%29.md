notes: "<div>This Dataset shows the boundary of Glasgow City Council Low Emission\
  \ Zone.</div>\n<div>A Low Emission Zone is an area where a person may not drive\
  \ a vehicle which does not meet a specified emission standard. LEZs are intended\
  \ to reduce pollution levels and improve air quality in areas where standards are\
  \ not being met. LEZs are based on a penalty notice approach to effectively ban\
  \ non-compliant vehicles.</div>\n<div>Glasgow's LEZ is being phased in to give everyone\
  \ time to prepare and\_</div>\n<div>from 1 June 2023, phase 2 (all vehicles)\_ Low\
  \ Emission Zone (LEZ) will come into force. All vehicles entering the city centre\
  \ zone area will need to meet the less-polluting emission standards or face a penalty\
  \ charge. There are some exemptions and zone residents have extra time to comply.</div>\n\
