notes: "<p>This is a non-spatial table.  It contains data on Scottish Forestry Grant\
  \ Scheme (SFGS) Management Plans that can be related to the SFGS Management Plans\
  \ spatial dataset on the SCHEME_NO field (Scheme Number).\_ The spatial dataset\
  \ is related to this non-spatial table on a 'one to many' basis.\_ This reflects\
  \ the fact that many operations may occur within one SFGS Management Plan.  This\
  \ dataset was extracted from the Grants and Licences System (GLS) that was used\
  \ by the Forestry Commission to manage grants for SFGS.\_ More details on SFGS and\
  \ the associated spatial data can be found in the metadata for the relevant spatial\
  \ datasets.  SFGS encouraged the creation and management of woods and forests to\
  \ provide economic, environmental and social benefits.  For more detailed information\
  \ please see the metadata record on Scotland's SpatialData.gov.scot Metadata Portal.</p>"
