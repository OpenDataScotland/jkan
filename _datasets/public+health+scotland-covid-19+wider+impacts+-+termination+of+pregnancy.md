notes: <p>As an essential service, care relating to termination of pregnancy has been
  provided throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Termination of pregnancy can be carried
  out as a medical procedure or, less commonly, a surgical procedure. Medical terminations
  involve the woman taking two different medicines 24-48 hours apart to end her pregnancy.
  Prior to October 2017, women having a medical termination were required to attend
  a clinic or hospital on two occasions to take the first and then, separately, the
  second medicine. From October 2017, women requiring an early medical termination
  (at up to 9 weeks and 6 days gestation) were able to take the second medicine away
  with them at the end of their first appointment, and subsequently take that at home.
  From 31 March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, women requiring an early
  medical termination (at up to 11 weeks and 6 days gestation) have been able to have
  an initial remote consultation, by telephone or video call, then take both medicines
  at home.\r\n\r\nTermination of pregnancy (also referred to as a therapeutic or induced
  abortion) is provided under the terms of the Abortion Act 1967 and subsequent regulations.
  When a healthcare practitioner provides a termination of pregnancy, there is a legal
  requirement for them to notify the Chief Medical Officer of the termination within
  seven days of it taking place. Public Health Scotland is responsible for the collation
  of data derived from notifications of terminations of pregnancy on behalf of the
  Chief Medical Officer. Detailed information on terminations is published each year
  by Public Health Scotland. The most recent report covers the year to December 2019.\r\n\r\nThis
  dataset presents information on the number of terminations of pregnancy carried
  out in Scotland, and the average gestation (stage of pregnancy) at which they occurred.
  Data is shown at Scotland and NHS Board level, as well as broken down by age group
  and deprivation. \r\n\r\nThis data is also available on the COVID-19 Wider Impact
  Dashboard. Additional data sources relating to this topic area are provided in the
