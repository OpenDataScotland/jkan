notes: '<p>HERs (Historic Environment Records) developed out of SMRs (Sites and Monuments
  Records). SMRs were established from the 1960s onwards in response to the loss of
  the archaeological resource through urban and rural development. From their original
  remit of recording archaeological sites, they have been developed to encompass a
  wide range of information about the historic environment which has been reflected
  in the change of name from SMR to HER. Today they provide a unique information resource,
  forming the basis for sustainable conservation and playing an important role in
  informing public understanding and enjoyment of the local historic environment.
  The historic environment includes all aspects of our surroundings that have been
  built, formed or influenced by human activities from earliest to most recent times.
  A Historic Environment Record stores and provides access to systematically organised
  information about these surroundings in a given area. It is maintained and updated
  for public benefit in accordance with national and international standards and guidance.
  An HER makes information accessible to all in order to: - advance knowledge and
  understanding of the historic environment; - inform its care and conservation; -
  inform public policies and decision-making on land-use planning and management;
  - contribute to environmental improvement and economic regeneration; - contribute
  to education and social inclusion; - encourage participation in the exploration,
  appreciation and enjoyment of the historic environment.  Local authorities and most
  National Park authorities maintain records of the archaeological, built and natural
  environment. However, many services group together to form archaeological services
  to collate their standardised records. Specialist staff are employed to curate these
  records and also to provide specialist advice for land-use planning and public information
  services.  This dataset has two distinct data layers:  - Historic Environment Sites
  (including Known Site Extents and Areas of Archaeological Interest) - Historic Environment
  Events (also known as interventions)  We strongly recommend that, when using the
  WFS for this dataset, because of it''s size you should use it with a filter.</p>'
