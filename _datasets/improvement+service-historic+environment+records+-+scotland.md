notes: '<p>HERs (Historic Environment Records) developed out of SMRs (Sites and Monuments
  Records). SMRs were established from the 1960s onwards in response to the loss of
  the archaeological resource through urban and rural development. From their original
  remit of recording archaeological sites, they have been developed to encompass a
  wide range of information about the historic environment which has been reflected
  in the change of name from SMR to HER. Today they provide a unique information resource,
  forming the basis for sustainable conservation and playing an important role in
  informing public understanding and enjoyment of the local historic environment.\nThe
  historic environment includes all aspects of our surroundings that have been built,
  formed or influenced by human activities from earliest to most recent times. A Historic
  Environment Record stores and provides access to systematically organised information
  about these surroundings in a given area. It is maintained and updated for public
  benefit in accordance with national and international standards and guidance. An
  HER makes information accessible to all in order to:\n- advance knowledge and understanding
  of the historic environment;\n- inform its care and conservation;\n- inform public
  policies and decision-making on land-use planning and management;\n- contribute
  to environmental improvement and economic regeneration;\n- contribute to education
  and social inclusion;\n- encourage participation in the exploration, appreciation
  and enjoyment of the historic environment.\n\nLocal authorities and most National
  Park authorities maintain records of the archaeological, built and natural environment.
  However, many services group together to form archaeological services to collate
  their standardised records. Specialist staff are employed to curate these records
  and also to provide specialist advice for land-use planning and public information
  services.\n\nThis dataset has two distinct data layers: \n- Historic Environment
  Sites (including Known Site Extents and Areas of Archaeological Interest)\n- Historic
  Environment Events (also known as interventions)\n\nWe strongly recommend that,
  when using the WFS for this dataset, because of it''s size you should use it with
  a filter.</p>'
