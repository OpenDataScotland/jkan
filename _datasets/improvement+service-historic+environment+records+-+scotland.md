notes: "<p>HERs (Historic Environment Records) developed out of SMRs (Sites and Monuments\
  \ Records). SMRs were established from the 1960s onwards in response to the loss\
  \ of the archaeological resource through urban and rural development. The expansion\
  \ of SMR/HERs to almost full UK-wide cover by 2004 was driven largely by their role\
  \ in land-use planning, which expanded after formal government guidance was issued\
  \ in the early 1990s: in Scotland this comprised 'National Planning Policy Guideline\
  \ 5 (NPPG 5)' and 'Planning Advice Note (PAN) 42 Archaeology - the Planning Process\
  \ and Scheduled Monument Procedures' (these were first issued in 1994 and have been\
  \ regularly reviewed and updated ever since). The protection and enhancement of\
  \ the historic environment is a key policy of NPF4 (Policy 7), which states that\
  \ development proposals should be informed by reference to HERs.   From their original\
  \ remit of recording archaeological sites, HERs have been developed to encompass\
  \ a wide range of information about the historic environment which has been reflected\
  \ in their change of name from SMR. Today they provide a unique information resource,\
  \ forming the basis for sustainable conservation and playing an important role in\
  \ informing public understanding and enjoyment of the local historic environment.\
  \ The historic environment includes all aspects of our surroundings that have been\
  \ built, formed, or influenced by human activities from earliest to most recent\
  \ times. The HER stores, and provides access to, systematically organised information\
  \ about these surroundings in a given area. It is maintained and updated for public\
  \ benefit in accordance with national and international standards and guidance.\
  \   An HER makes information accessible to all in order to:   \u2022 advance knowledge\
  \ and understanding of the historic environment.   \u2022    inform its care and\
  \ conservation.   \u2022   inform public policies and decision-making on land use\
  \ planning and management.   \u2022 contribute to environmental improvement and\
  \ economic regeneration.   \u2022  contribute to education and social inclusion,\
  \ and  \u2022    encourage participation in the exploration, appreciation, and enjoyment\
  \ of the historic environment.  Most Local Planning Authorities (LPAs) maintain\
  \ records of the historic (archaeological, built, and occasionally natural) environment.\
  \ Some LPAs group together to collate their standardised records. Specialist staff\
  \ and archaeological services (e.g., the West of Scotland Archaeology Service) curate\
  \ these records and also to provide specialist advice for land-use planning and\
  \ public information services.  A few LPAs do not collate or curate an HER for their\
  \ areas. Historic environment data hosted on the Spatial Hub for these LPA areas\
  \ (listed below) is taken from the Canmore database, maintained by Historic Environment\
  \ Scotland (HES).  It is important to note that Canmore data is not equivalent to\
  \ HER data. HER data are spatially defined and dynamically curated to be relevant\
  \ to land use management and historic change over time, while Canmore at its core\
  \ is a spatial index to the archive holdings of HES in various formats. Therefore,\
  \ Canmore-derived data should not be used for land management or planning purposes\
  \ due to its fundamental difference from HER data.  This dataset has two distinct\
  \ data layers:  \u2022   Historic Environment Sites (i.e., known locations and extents\
  \ of archaeological monuments, features, historic buildings, and findspots, as well\
  \ as Areas of Archaeological Interest; places known, or likely, to be particularly\
  \ rich in archaeological features)  \u2022    Historic Environment Events (i.e.,\
  \ archaeological investigations and excavations, historic building surveys, environmental\
  \ impact assessments etc.)  We strongly recommend that, when using the WFS for this\
  \ dataset, because of its size you should use it with a filter.  LPAs using Canmore\
  \ data:  \u2022 City of Edinburgh \u2022 Dundee \u2022    Falkirk \u2022   Fife\
  \ \u2022  Inverclyde \u2022    North Lanarkshire \u2022 Orkney Islands</p>"
