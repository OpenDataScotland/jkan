notes: "<p><b>This dataset is published as Open Data and is a like-for-like extract\
  \ from the Scottish Government's publication, filtered to the 121 datazones within\
  \ the Stirling Council area, with the addition of SAPE 2021 figures. We have published\
  \ other SIMD datasets, maps, and applications also available as Open Data.</b><div><br\
  \ /></div><div><div>The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation is a relative measure\
  \ of deprivation across 6,976 small areas (called data zones). If an area is identified\
  \ as \u2018deprived\u2019, this can relate to people having a low income but it\
  \ can also mean fewer resources or opportunities. SIMD looks at the extent to which\
  \ an area is deprived across seven domains: income, employment, education, health,\
  \ access to services, crime and housing.</div><div><br /></div><div>SIMD is the\
  \ Scottish Government's standard approach to identify areas of multiple deprivation\
  \ in Scotland. It can help improve understanding about the outcomes and circumstances\
  \ of people living in the most deprived areas in Scotland. It can also allow effective\
  \ targeting of policies and funding where the aim is to wholly or partly tackle\
  \ or take account of area concentrations of multiple deprivation.</div><div><br\
  \ /></div><div>SIMD ranks data zones from most deprived (ranked 1) to least deprived\
  \ (ranked 6,976). People using SIMD will often focus on the data zones below a certain\
  \ rank, for example, the 5%, 10%, 15% or 20% most deprived data zones in Scotland.</div><div><br\
  \ /></div><div>SIMD is an area-based measure of relative deprivation: not every\
  \ person in a highly deprived area will themselves be experiencing high levels of\
  \ deprivation.</div><div><br /></div><div>Data zones in rural areas tend to cover\
  \ a large land area and reflect a more mixed picture of people experiencing different\
  \ levels of deprivation. This means that SIMD is less helpful at identifying the\
  \ smaller pockets of deprivation found in more rural areas, compared to the larger\
  \ pockets found in urban areas. SIMD domain indicators can still be useful in rural\
  \ areas if analysed separately from urban data zones or combined with other data.</div><div><br\
  \ /></div><div>Please note that the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation 2020\
  \ has been revised as a result of a problem identified with the income domain ranks\
  \ provided by the Department for Work and Pensions. This revision only affects the\
  \ income domain ranks and overall SIMD ranks (referred to as SIMD 2020v2). The impact\
  \ is minimal for the majority of data zones, and the remainder of the SIMD 2020\
  \ is not affected. SIMD 2020v2 ranks should now be used when carrying out any analyses.</div></div><div><br\
