  \ 2020 &amp; September 2023. A Community Council is a voluntary organisation set\
  \ up by statute by the Local Authority and run by local residents to act on behalf\
  \ of its area. As the most local tier of elected representation, Community Councils\
  \ play an important role in local democracy. Some Community Councils are &quot;not\
  \ established &quot; or &quot;inactive&quot; so have no representation. Check the\
  \ PKC website for the latest status (https://www.pkc.gov.uk/communitycouncilcontacts).</span></p><div\
