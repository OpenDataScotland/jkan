notes: "<p>There are many areas where the scenery is highly valued locally and local\
  \ authorities often give these landscapes a local designation. This is to ensure\
  \ that the landscape is not damaged by inappropriate development, and in some cases\
  \ encourage positive landscape management. These designations play an important\
  \ role in developing an awareness of the landscape qualities that make particular\
  \ areas distinctive and promote a community's sense of pride in their surroundings.</p>\n\
  <p>The names used for such Local Landscape Areas currently vary from one local authority\
  \ to another. For example, they are termed 'Areas of Great Landscape Value' in Moray,\
  \ 'Special Landscape Areas' in Dumfries and Galloway, and 'Sensitive Landscape Character\
  \ Areas' in Ayrshire. Guidance published by NatureScot and Historic Environment\
  \ Scotland (see below) suggests the name be standardised to Local Landscape Areas\
  \ (LLA) now. LLAs complement the National Scenic Area designation, which identifies\
  \ those landscapes that are seen as nationally important owing to their unsurpassed\
  \ scenery.\n https://www.nature.scot/professional-advice/protected-areas-and-species/protected-areas/local-designations/local-landscape-areas</p>\n\
  <p>Site name and Website URL (for more information) are now mandatory attributes\
  \ for this dataset.</p>"
