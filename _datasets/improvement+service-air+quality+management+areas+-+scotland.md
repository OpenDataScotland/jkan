notes: "<p>Local Authorities have a duty to designate any relevant areas where the\
  \ air quality objectives are not (or are unlikely to be) being met as Air Quality\
  \ Management Areas (AQMAs).  AQMAs must be designated officially by means of an\
  \ 'order'.  The extent of the AQMA may be limited to the area of exceedance or encompass\
  \ a larger area.  Following the declaration of an AQMA, the local authority is required\
  \ to develop and implement a plan (Air Quality Action Plan) to improve air quality\
  \ in that area. AQMAs can be for a combination of NO2, SO2, PM10.</p>\n<p>Most data\
  \ provided by local authorities is in polygon format. However, some is provided\
  \ in point and line form so we are currently buffering such data by the width of\
  \ a road or so in order to merge them in to the national polygon dataset. Some smaller\
  \ local authorities e.g. Dundee, use the entire extent of their local authority,\
  \ as digitised in Ordnance Survey's BoundaryLine dataset, for the AQMA.</p>\n<p>We\
  \ have included date of AQMA declaration in our national schema, though many LAs\
  \ do not currently provide this.\n Revoked AQMAs are now held in this dataset with\
  \ a 'Date revoked' attribute</p>"
