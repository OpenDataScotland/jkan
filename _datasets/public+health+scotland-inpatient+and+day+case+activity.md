notes: <p>A patient is termed an inpatient when they occupy a staffed bed in a hospital
  and either remain overnight (whether intended or not) or are expected to remain
  overnight but are discharged earlier. An inpatient\u2019s admission can be an emergency,
  an elective or a transfer. A day case is when a patient makes a planned attendance
  for one day to a specialty for clinical care and requires the use of a bed (or trolley
  in lieu of a bed). Although a day case is usually completed on the same day, the
  patient may need to be admitted as an inpatient if they are not fit to be discharged.\r\n</p>
