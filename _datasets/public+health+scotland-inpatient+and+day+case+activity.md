notes: <p>A patient is termed an inpatient when they occupy a staffed bed in a hospital
  and either remain overnight (whether intended or not) or are expected to remain
  overnight but are discharged earlier. An inpatient\u2019s admission can be an emergency,
  an elective or a transfer. A day case is when a patient makes a planned attendance
  for one day to a specialty for clinical care and requires the use of a bed (or trolley
  in lieu of a bed). Although a day case is usually completed on the same day, the
  patient may need to be admitted as an inpatient if they are not fit to be discharged.\r\n\r\nThe
  residence data files relate to activity by NHS board of residence. The treatment
  data files relate to activity by NHS board of treatment.\r\n\r\nAll publications
