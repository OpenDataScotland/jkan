notes: "<p>This metadata record refers to the polygon dataset. The point and polyline\
  \ datasets are obsolete prototypes, for the moment, and this record will be corrected\
  \ as these datasets are republished.  The Local Development Plan dataset is a composition\
  \ of Local Development Plans supplied by local authorities and national parks in\
  \ Scotland. It is intended to provide a spatial overview of common policies across\
  \ Scotland. The authoritative data source is the originating data supplied by the\
  \ planning authority and the authoritative plan is that which is published as approved\
  \ and adopted by the planning authority, which may not be in a digital format. \
  \  Development plans set out the long term vision for where development should and\
  \ shouldn\u2019t happen in the places they cover. The local development plan is\
  \ the principal land use planning document used in assessing applications for planning\
  \ permission, based upon national, regional and local policies and proposals. It\
  \ is the most significant material consideration in determining such applications\
  \ and reference to the local development plan is essential for most types of proposed\
  \ development. The main spatial element is typically the policies and proposals\
  \ map, which is created from the data that is also used in this dataset. Some policies\
  \ will be plan-wide, and not reproduced spatially, so this dataset contains policy\
  \ data that is linked to a discrete area within the planning authority area.   In\
  \ addition to the local development plan, reference should be made to National Planning\
  \ Framework 4 and supplementary guidance that is included in the development plan.\
  \   Update and reference to other datasets  This dataset will be updated as and\
  \ when development plans are replaced and formally adopted by authorities, on a\
  \ minimum quarterly basis in operational terms each year. Local development plans\
  \ are currently replaced on a five year basis and will be further modified by the\
  \ forthcoming Planning Act, likely moving to a ten year cycle with interim updates,\
  \ although it is not yet clear on how updates will be prepared. If proposed and\
  \ draft plans (and other datasets, such as issues reports) are published on the\
  \ Spatial Hub, this will be as a separate dataset.   This dataset should be used\
  \ in conjunction with other planning related datasets available on the Spatial Hub,\
  \ notably planning applications, conservation areas, housing land and employment\
  \ land. There may be some duplication with related layers, due to the ways that\
  \ particular authorities may share data, and this will be resolved on a layer-by-layer\
  \ basis as this dataset (and others) are developed. This is also true for some national\
  \ datasets, such as statutory designations for natural heritage: these typically\
  \ originate with other agencies although they are often published as part of a local\
  \ development plan. This will also be resolved, in data architecture terms, through\
  \ dialogue with these key agencies.  Geometries  There are three layers within this\
  \ dataset, for point, polyline and polygon features. Not all authorities capture\
  \ all three feature types.   Categorisation  The dataset has a basic taxonomy of\
  \ \"type\" which is a short description of the type of land use, where this can\
  \ be identified, from the attribute data. Other attributes refer to \"feature_name\"\
  , a reproduction of what is provided that best fits the name of a site or area,\
  \ similar for \"reference\" where such data is provided, and also \"year\" and \"\
  status\" for the year of plan adoption, draft publication or proposal or similar.\
  \  Known Issues  This is an early release of the dataset, which will change further\
  \ following consultation with users, planning authorities and other stakeholders.\
  \ In the longer term, a move towards common standards and categorisation will be\
  \ promoted.   Further Information  The definitive description is contained within\
  \ the published Development Plan Scheme for each planning authority, available online.\
