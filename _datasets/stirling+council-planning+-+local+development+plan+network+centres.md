  <p>Town centres and other retail centres are defined by local authorities to meet
  the requirement of Scottish Planning Policy (paragraph 61) to identify town centres
  and other retail locations as part of a network of centres to support retail type
  development in the most appropriate locations. This network of centres forms part
  of the sequential test in assessing retail planning applications, which should be
  located firstly in town centres, then in other retail centres or edge-of-centre
  sites, so the dataset provides key locational information in assisting retail planning
  and policies. These centres may be defined in local development plans in the first
  instance.</p>'
