notes: "<div><span style='font-weight:bold;'>This dataset will be published as Open\
  \ Data</span><br /></div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>This dataset was created by joining\
  \ Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation Datazone geographies and The Priority Places\
  \ for Food Index which was developed by the CDRC at the University of Leeds in collaboration\
  \ with Which?.<br /></div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>A  composite index formed of\
  \ data compiled across seven different  dimensions relating to food insecurity risk\
  \ for the four nations in the  UK. This version (Version 2.1, July 2024) reflects\
  \ changes to the data  and policy landscape which are detailed in the user guide\
  \ below.</div>\n<p>The  Priority Places for Food Index (https://priorityplaces.cdrc.ac.uk/)\
  \ is  constructed using open data to capture complex and multidimensional  aspects\
  \ of food insecurity risk. The index was initially developed in  response to the\
  \ 2022 cost of living crisis which has put many of our  communities under severe\
  \ financial pressure and at an increased risk of  food insecurity. Building on the\
  \ CDRC e-food desert index (EFDI), but  with additional domains relating to fuel\
  \ poverty and family food  support, the goal of the Priority Places for Food Index\
  \ is to identify  neighbourhoods that are most vulnerable to increases in the cost\
  \ of  living and which have a lack of accessibility to cheap, healthy, and  sustainable\
  \ sources of food.From version 1 to version 2, data  have been updated across several\
  \ of the seven PPFI domains. This  includes new area socio-demographics, foodbank,\
  \ and food retailer  location data. Data relating to Free School Meal eligibility\
  \ has also  been updated to reflect the changing policy landscape and to address\
  \  regional inconsistencies in policies. Areas may look different to  version one\
  \ as a result of the new data incorporated or changes to  neighbourhood boundaries.\
  \ Because of these data changes we recommend  that you don\u2019t make comparisons\
  \ between the versions.The index  can be used to inform supermarket location analytics,\
  \ improve the  availability of budget food lines, and to ensure scare resources\
  \ are  targeted effectively.<span style='font-weight:bold;'>Note: </span>Subject\
  \  to the Department of Health and Social Care making a statement  highlighting\
  \ inaccuracies in the Healthy Start Uptake data between July  2023-February 2024,\
  \ we have updated Version 2 of the Priority Places for  Food Index (PPFI). Version\
  \ 2.1 of the PPFI replaces the October 2023  uptake of Healthy Start Vouchers values\
  \ with the average voucher uptake  between January and June 2023 to minimise the\
  \ impact on the Priority  Places for Food Index insights.</p>\n<p><br /><br /><br\
