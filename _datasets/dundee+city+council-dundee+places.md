notes: "<p>As part of an exciting collaboration with Dundee Place Partnership, <a\
  \ href=\"https://creativedundee.com/\">Creative Dundee</a> has been doing some research\
  \ and consultation to find out more about the cultural and creative happenings across\
  \ the city. For 5 months, they have been to many of Dundee\u2019s community hubs\
  \ and events with a big map of the city where people could pin down their favourite\
  \ places to go, and fill a short survey about the activities they like doing in\
  \ their free time and what they\u2019d like to see happening across the city. The\
  \ places are shared in this dataset. Read more about the research and see other\
  \ results on Creative Dundee's website. </p>"
