notes: <p>Congenital conditions are variations of body structure or function which
  are present from birth. A baby\u2019s condition (or conditions) may be due to an
  underlying genetic variation, or exposure of the mother to factors that disrupt
  normal development. In many cases, no specific cause is found. Increasingly, conditions
  can be detected during pregnancy through antenatal screening.\r\n\r\nThe Congenital
  Conditions and Rare Diseases Registration and Information Service for Scotland (CARDRISS)
  was set up in 2018 to establish a new national, prospective register of babies with
  congenital and rare conditions (the CARDRISS register). As an interim measure whilst
  the register is being established, the CARDRISS team have brought together existing
  national records to produce a linked dataset on babies with congenital conditions
  (the Scottish Linked Congenital Condition Dataset, SLiCCD). As the CARDRISS register
  is not yet up and running, this publication uses SLiCCD to provide current best
  estimates of the occurrence of major congenital conditions among pregnancies ending
  in Scotland in 2000 to 2020 inclusive. Live born babies diagnosed before their first
  birthday; miscarriages and stillbirths from 20 weeks of pregnancy onwards; and terminations
  of pregnancy at any stage of pregnancy are all counted. We will update and publish
  these estimates every year until the CARDRISS register can be used as the source
  of national statistics on conditions.\r\n\r\nThis open data includes 2 tables. The
  first includes data on the numbers and rates of congenital conditions at Scotland
  level. The second includes data on rates per congenital condition per health board.
  The rates are per 10,000 births.</p>
