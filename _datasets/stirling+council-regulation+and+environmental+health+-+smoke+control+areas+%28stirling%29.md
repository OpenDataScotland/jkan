  <p>Under Section 18 of the Clean Air Act 1993, many parts of Scotland are Smoke
  Control Areas. If you live in a smoke control area it is an offence to produce smoke
  from a chimney of a building, or a chimney of any fixed boiler or industrial plant,
  unless you''re burning an authorised fuel or using exempt appliances (e.g. burners
  or stoves). In practice, this means that in a smoke control area it is illegal to
  burn house coal or wood in an open fire, although it is legal to burn these in a
  stove or other appliance that has been approved to burn that fuel. It is also illegal
  to deliver any unauthorised solid fuels, e.g. wood and normal house coal, to any
  premises in a smoke control area unless the seller can demonstrate that they were
  aware that the unauthorised solid fuel is to be burnt in an exempt appliance.</p>'
