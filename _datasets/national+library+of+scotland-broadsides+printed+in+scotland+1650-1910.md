notes: "<p>Trial the data: This dataset comprises nearly 1,800 broadsides printed\
  \ in Scotland. They have been acquired by the National Library since 1925; many\
  \ of them form part of the Lauriston Castle Collection, which was bequeathed to\
  \ the Library in 1926. Broadsides are single sheet items printed on one side only;\
  \ they were designed to be read unfolded and posted up in public places. They were\
  \ originally used for the printing of royal proclamations, acts, and official notices.\
  \ From the second half of the 17th century onwards they became a format widely used\
  \ for political agitation and were an essential part of printed popular culture,\
  \ reporting on current hot topics of conversation and scandalous events, such as:\
  \ violent crimes, the trial and scaffold speeches of convicted criminals, prize\
  \ fights, mysterious apparitions etc. They also reproduced the words of popular\
  \ ballads. Most broadsides cost one penny which was just about within the means\
  \ of most working people, whereas quality prints at an average of 2s 6d each were\
  \ well beyond the means of the working class and even lower middle class artisans.\
  \ Many of the printers who produced broadsides would also have printed other kinds\
  \ of \u2018street literature\u2019 such as chapbooks, tracts, playbills and garlands\
  \ (collection of love songs in pamphlet form). Broadsides were mainly pages of text,\
  \ but occasionally illustrations were added to grab attention. Generally illustrations\
  \ were made with crude woodcuts, used again and again. In many cases, the illustration\
  \ bore little or no relation to the text. Although many 18th-century woodblocks\
  \ were still in use, the more refined process of wood-engraving was being adopted\
  \ by the early 19th century. This advancement in the illustrative process \u2013\
  \ together with the mechanisation of printing \u2013 made images increasingly available\
  \ to a wider public. Printers of broadsides worked on the assumption that the more\
  \ and the bigger the images they could put on a sheet, the more copies they would\
  \ sell. Sometimes the printers distributed their own wares, but they relied to a\
  \ great extent on pedlars, hawkers, street criers and chapmen, who played a very\
  \ important role in the commercial life of the country 200 years ago. Hawkers would\
  \ buy broadsides from the printers in urban centres like Glasgow, Edinburgh, Falkirk\
  \ and Stirling. They would sing and shout about the latest publication on the streets\
  \ or carry them to markets and fairs throughout Scotland. The mechanisation of the\
  \ printing industry in the early 19th century saw a phenomenal increase in the output\
  \ of all types of street literature, including broadsides. However by the middle\
  \ of the century, the cheap newspaper and latterly the \u2018penny dreadful\u2019\
  \ (sensational novels) were beginning to take over from broadsides and other forms\
  \ of street literature. Newspapers, which had been around since the mid-17th century,\
  \ became increasingly important as working-class reading, and, thanks to the reduction\
  \ and eventual abolition of stamp duty on newspapers in 1855, they became more affordable\
  \ to an increasingly literate population. Moreover, the mass-circulation newspapers\
  \ and periodicals set a premium on accurate and first-hand visual reporting. Their\
  \ readership was no longer willing to accept the often sensationalised and slipshod\
  \ work of the broadside printers, so broadsides disappeared as a popular printed\
  \ format in the second half of the 19th century.</p>"
