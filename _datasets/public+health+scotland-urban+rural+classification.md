notes: '<p>The Scottish Government Urban Rural Classification provides a consistent
  way of defining urban and rural areas across Scotland. The classification is based
  upon two main criteria: (i) population as defined by the National Records of Scotland,
  and (ii) accessibility based on drive time analysis to differentiate between accessible
  and remote areas in Scotland.\r\n\r\nThere are four levels for classification \r\n\r\n<em>
  2-fold \r\n\r\n</em> 3-fold\r\n\r\n<em> 6-fold \r\n\r\n</em> 8-fold</p>'
