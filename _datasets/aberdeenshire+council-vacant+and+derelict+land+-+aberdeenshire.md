notes: "<p>The Scottish Vacant and Derelict Land Survey is a national data collection\
  \ undertaken to establish the extent and state of vacant and derelict land in Scotland.\
  \ The survey has been operating since 1988. This survey is associated with the Scottish\
  \ Vacant and Derelict Land Fund, under which cash allocations are made to local\
  \ authorities. </p>\n<p>Every year the Scottish Government Communities Analytical\
  \ Services produce a comprehensive national survey based on data collected and processed\
  \ from all Local Authorities and Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park Authority.\
  \ The Spatial Hub takes this survey data and joins it (using site ID) to the polygon\
  \ site information provided by local authorities.</p>\n<p>To create this dataset\
  \ we have taken all of the spatial data provided by councils for the current survey\
  \ year and combined it to this year's statistical survey (using the site reference).\
  \ However: \n - where local authorities have not provided spatial data for the current\
  \ year, we have used their previous spatial data return and matched the survey data\
  \ as best we can,\n - where there is no spatial data at all for sites we have buffered\
  \ the easting and northing provided in the survey, to create the rough polygon area\
  \ for a site.                                                                  \
