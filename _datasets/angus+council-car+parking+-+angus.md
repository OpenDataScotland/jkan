notes: "<p>Most councils will keep a record of their car parks, bays and zones. Therefore\
  \ we have tried to compile these into consistent national layers.</p>\n<p>Currently,\
  \ we publish three layers:\n - Car Parks - a polygon layer\n - Parking Bays - a\
  \ polygon layer\n - Parking Zones - a polygon layer</p>\n<p>Any supplied point records\
  \ have been buffered (bays by 2m, car parks by 10m) to create a representative area,\
  \ allowing them to be incorporated in the national dataset</p>"
