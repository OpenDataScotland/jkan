  \ Data platform https://data.stirling.gov.uk.\_</b><br /></div>\n<div><br /></div>\n\
  <div>Under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) (Scotland) Act\
  \ 1997 a local authority may determine which parts of its area are of special architectural\
  \ or historic interest and may designate these as Conservation Areas. The public\
  \ will normally be consulted on any proposal to designate conservation areas or\
  \ to change their boundaries.\_</div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>There are over 600\
  \ Conservation Areas in Scotland. Many were designated in the early 1970s, but some\
  \ have since been re-designated, merged, renamed, given smaller or larger boundaries\
  \ and new ones have been added. They can cover historic land, battlefields, public\
  \ parks, designed landscapes or railways but most contain groups of buildings extending\
  \ over areas of a village, town or city. Further planning controls on development\
  \ can be made by way of an Article 4 Direction, which may or may not be associated\
  \ with a Conservation Area.</div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>An Article 4 Direction\
  \ is not a conservation designation but an additional control within such areas.\
  \ It is a statement made under The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted\
  \ Development) (Scotland) Amendment Order 2011. The Direction, made by a local authority\
  \ and approved by Scottish Ministers, removes all or some of the permitted development\
  \ rights on an area.</div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>The effect of a Direction is\
  \ that planning permission will be required for specific types of development which\
  \ would otherwise be regarded as 'permitted development', i.e. development that\
  \ does not require a planning application. Directions can cover a variety of minor\
  \ works and might include: the replacement of doors and windows, the erection of\
  \ gates, fences, garages, sheds, porches, storage tanks or the installation of satellite\
  \ antennae.</div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>This dataset should be used in conjunction\
  \ with the Article 4 Directions dataset also published on a Scotland-wide basis.</div>"
