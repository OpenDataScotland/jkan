notes: '<p>This dataset shows the latest results of the Public Health Scotland (PHS)
  serology surveillance programme. The PHS serology surveillance programme uses existing
  blood samples within community healthcare and other settings to estimate the proportion
  of people who have antibodies to coronavirus ("seroprevalence") in the general population
  of Scotland and to see if this changes over time. Antibodies can be used to identify
  individuals who have had COVID-19 infection in the past or have developed antibodies
  as a result of vaccination.\r\n\r\nThis data is also available on the Enhanced Surveillance
  of Covid-19 in Scotland Dashboard along with detailed commentary and background
  information on interpreting the data. The dashboard can be accessed from the <a
  href="https://www.publichealthscotland.scot/publications/enhanced-surveillance-of-covid-19-in-scotland/">Enhanced
  Surveillance of Covid-19 in Scotland publication</a> page. The date of the next
  release can be found on our list of <a href="https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/forthcoming-publications/">forthcoming
  publications</a>. Additional data sources relating to this topic area are provided
  in the Links section of the Metadata below. Information on COVID-19, including stay
  at home advice for people who are self-isolating and their households, can be found
  on <a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19#stay-at-home-advice">NHS
  Inform</a>.\r\n\r\n__Revisions have been made to our antenatal data: from week beginning
  7th June 2021 (ISO week 23 of 2021), we can detect which antibodies are from vaccination
  and which are from infection (+/- vaccination). These changes can be seen in the
  dashboard publications from 10th November 2021 onwards. More detail regarding these
  changes can be found in the notes section of the dashboard.__</p>'
