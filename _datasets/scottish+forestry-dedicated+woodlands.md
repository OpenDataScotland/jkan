notes: <p>The Dedication Scheme (Basis I &amp; II) was introduced in 1947 in order
  to encourage landowners to retain their land in forestry and to introduce good forestry
  practice. Basis III was introduced in 1974, providing grants for new planting and
  additional supplements for broadleaves.    The Dedication Scheme was closed to new
  applicants in 1981. Land still under Dedication could continue to be within the
  scheme but Dedication would terminate on a change of ownership.    Dedication schemes
  without a Plan of Operations and therefore receiving no grant, are deemed to be
  under Negative Covenant.    For more detailed information please see the metadata
  record on Scotland's SpatialData.gov.scot Metadata Portal.</p>
