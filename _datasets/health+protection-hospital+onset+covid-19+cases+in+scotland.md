notes: <p>Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare Associated Infection (ARHAI) Scotland,
  part of National Services Scotland works closely with Public Health Scotland to
  deliver the COVID-19 response. This dataset provides data for COVID-19 hospital
  onset cases in Scotland for week ending 1 March 2020 onwards, as available.\r\nCOVID-19
  cases first diagnosed within hospital in-patients are classed as hospital onset
  COVID-19, with the length of time between admission and the date of first positive
  test of new infections or reinfection episodes (90 days from previous COVID-19 positive
  result), determining their hospital onset status. \r\nARHAI Scotland is working
  with NHS boards on a continuous basis to validate COVID-19 hospital onset cases
  to ensure the data are robust. Data are published on the Open Data platform at NHS
  Scotland level, by week of specimen date.\r\nAll publications and supporting material
  to this topic area can be found in the weekly <a href="https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/hospital-onset-covid-19-cases-in-scotland/">Hospital
