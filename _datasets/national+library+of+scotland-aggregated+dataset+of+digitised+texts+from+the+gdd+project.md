notes: "<p>Trial the data: Date published: 28/2/20 The Global Digitised Dataset Network\
  \ (GDD Network) was an AHRC-funded research collaboration from 2019-2020 investigating\
  \ the feasibility of creating a global catalogue of digitised texts. This would\
  \ enable people to search and find texts, and access them for reading, digital scholarship,\
  \ collections analysis, and more. This is an aggregated dataset of digitised records\
  \ created by the Global Digitisation Dataset project in 2019, an AHRC funded project\
  \ under the UK/US Digital Scholarship in Cultural Institutions networking fund.\
  \ The records come from the project\u2019s members: HathiTrust, National Library\
  \ of Scotland, British Library and the National Library of Wales. Each record in\
  \ the dataset contains limited bibliographic metadata, along with a link to the\
  \ item. The dataset was created as a proof of concept, merging records of digitised\
  \ texts from different organisations together. Related links Visit the project website:\
