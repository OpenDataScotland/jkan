notes: '<p>Primary 1 Body Mass Index (BMI) statistics capture important information
  of the growth of young children. Data are presented by: NHS health board, council
  area, deprivation and sex.\r\n\r\nA <a href="https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/primary-1-body-mass-index-bmi-statistics-scotland/">full
  publication report</a> and <a href="https://publichealthscotland.scot/media/6548/2020-12-15-p1-bmi-statistics-technical-report.pdf">technical
  report</a> are available. \r\n\r\nAll publications and supporting material to this

  Scotland - Child Health Website</a>. The date of the next release can be found on
  our list of <a href="https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/forthcoming-publications/">forthcoming
  publications</a>.\r\n\r\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has had a detrimental impact on coverage
  of P1 reviews in 2019/20 as many of these had not been carried out prior to the
  closure of schools in March. Analysis of reviews for 2019/20 has shown that the
  Scotland level data is broadly representative of a \u2018normal\u2019 school year,
  nonetheless the low coverage means that Scotland level results shown should be treated
  with a degree of caution. Analysis of BMI distribution is shown for individual NHS
  Boards and local authorities where the coverage exceeds 50%, but is not shown for
  the areas with low coverage. \r\n</p>'
