  <div>Community councils are required to be established by local authorities. They\
  \ are the most local tier of statutory representation in Scotland. They bridge the\
  \ gap between local authorities and communities and help to make public bodies aware\
  \ of the opinions and needs of the communities they represent. Community councils\
  \ are statutory consultees under various processes, such as for planning applications.</div>\n\
  <div><br /></div>\n<div>There are many instances where polygons do not tessellate\
  \ or snap to local authority boundaries. Such gaps in the dataset mean that it cannot\
  \ potentially be used for some kinds of spatial analysis e.g. point in polygon,\
  \ because some point locations may fall within the gaps.</div>"
