notes: <p>Local authorities are required to conduct an annual survey of the housing
  land supply, the Housing Land Audit, to determine completions within the timeframe
  and update forecasts of the housing land supply. This, in turn, helps inform land
  releases within the Local Development Plan process and ongoing development management
  decisions.  The housing land supply dataset contains a full range of local authorities
  and includes full details - where available - of site references, completions and
  remaining supply. Further details of greenfield/brownfield status, tenure, effectiveness
  (deliverable within the period), constraints, planning details/status and developer
  are also provided where available.  The housing land supply 2022/23 dataset includes
  additional information for the 20 local authorities who have completed and shared
  their 2022/23 housing land audit. This includes site status, planning references,
  local development plan references, and predicted completions over time, proposed
  numbers of houses and flats and developer (where available).  Some of the geometry
  is represented by a buffer on a recorded X/Y easting/northing where polygons were
  not available.</p>
