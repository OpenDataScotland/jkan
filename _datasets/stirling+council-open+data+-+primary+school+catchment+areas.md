notes: '<div><b>This dataset is published as Open Data</b></div>

  <div><br /></div>

  <div>Scottish local authorities usually divide towns and country areas into catchments
  and children living in a catchment area will usually go to the same local school.
  Domestic properties typically have a catchment area for each of their local: - primary
  non-denominational (PN), - secondary non-denominational (SN), - primary denominational
  / Catholic (PD) and - secondary denominational / Catholic (SD) schools.</div>

  <div><br /></div>

  <div>There are four denomination primary schools within the Stirling Council area
  and there are no defined catchments for each.<br /></div>'
