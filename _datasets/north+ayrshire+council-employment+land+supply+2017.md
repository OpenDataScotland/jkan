notes: <p>Scottish Planning Policy sets out the Scottish Governments policies in relation
  to economic development in Scotland. An Employment Land Audit is produced to monitor
  the supply, take up and status of employment land in line with National Guidance.
  The audit assesses the range and choice of marketable sites and locations for businesses
  with a variety of size and quality requirements. The audit identifies the availability
  and constraints of employment land sites within the local authority.</p>
