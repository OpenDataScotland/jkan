  \ Most councils already have a FWS and these are normally accompanied by spatial\
  \ data. However, most do not seem to be openly available online.\n Some of the strategies\
  \ are produced jointly across Councils, e.g. Striling and Clackmannanshire, Edinburgh\
  \ and Lothians, Glasgow Clyde Valley.\n Generally, the FWS datasets contain similar\
  \ attribution which identifies the FWS Classication, or the potential areas fro\
  \ woodland expansion. The attribtuion is usually along the lines of Preffered, Potential,\
  \ Sensitive, Unsuitable.\n Some of the councils have produced a few layers of data\
  \ for their FWS which might apply specifically to woodland planting types, e.g.\
  \ a seperate FWS layer for native woodlands or for productive woodlands.</p>"
