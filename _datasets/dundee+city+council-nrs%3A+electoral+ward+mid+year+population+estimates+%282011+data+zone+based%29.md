notes: <p>National Records of Scotland publish mid year electoral ward population
  estimates on an annual basis.\r\nThe mid year population estimates for the electoral
  wards are based on the data zone based population estimates. NRS have used a best
  fit methodology to assign each data zone to a particular electoral ward. \r\n\r\nNRS
  have published a methodology paper on their website which explains in detail how
  the electoral ward based population estimates were created as well as supplying
  links to further information. The document states that electoral ward population
  estimates are based on small area population estimates which are used to assign
  the 2011 data zones to a particular electoral ward. 2011 data zones do not fit exactly
  into electoral ward boundaries and are allocated on a "best fit" basis. Where a
  data zone crosses the boundary of two or more electoral wards it is allocated to
  the one that contains the population-weighted centroid of the data zone.\r\n\r\nThe
  most recent electoral ward population estimates for the period 2001-2021 as well
  as the publication methodology document is available on the National Records of
  Scotland Website and can be accessed by clicking on the link below:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/population/population-estimates/2011-based-special-area-population-estimates/electoral-ward-population-estimates\r\n\r\n\xa9
