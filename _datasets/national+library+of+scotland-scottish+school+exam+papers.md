notes: "<p>Trial the data: The Education (Scotland) Act 1872 is the basis for the\
  \ modern Scottish education system. It established a \u2018non-sectarian\u2019 network\
  \ of public schooling controlled by what was then known as the \u2018Scotch\u2019\
  \ Education Department based at Whitehall, London. This collection \_consists of\
  \ the Scottish School Exam papers for the very first \u2018Leavers\u2019 certificate\
  \ exam paper in 1888 up to 1963 and the circulars for the Scottish Education Department\
  \ (1889-1942). From a historical perspective these papers reflect how education\
  \ developed in Scotland over these 75 years. The early 20 th century saw increased\
  \ state intervention in education as schools came to be seen as an important agency\
  \ for social welfare. Among other changes the 1908 Education (Scotland) Act made\
  \ parents responsible for their children\u2019s education. In the absence of regulations\
  \ on how education and the exams were to be administered in Scotland the circulars\
  \ provided policy and guidance on many subjects including the raising of the school\
  \ age, introduction of school milk, moral instruction, broadcasting in schools and\
  \ the effect the war had on staff and pupils.</p>"
