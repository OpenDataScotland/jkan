notes: '<p><em>Whilst TPOs are a legal requirement they may not always be digitised
  accurately. Users of this data should not assume this data is totally accurate and
  should consult the specific local authority for more detail before making any decisions</em></p>

  <p>A legal title plan &amp; associated description protecting a tree or trees within
  a defined area from development. The dataset is created under the provisions as
  listed within The Town and Country Planning (Tree Preservation Order and Trees in
  Conservation Areas) (Scotland) Regulations 2010. Spatial and attribute data is maintained
  in ArcMap shapefile with extra attributes in a spreadsheet (including link to TPO
  PDF). Planning technicians ensure that data is updated regularly once new information
  about a TPO is provided, a new TPO is registered or a TPO has been removed. The
  conservation officers or senior management advise and direct planning technicians
  to create a draft TPO location plan which is then sent to the paralegal team. The
  paralegals then carry out their duties in confirming and registering the TPO and
  informing any interested party. The planning technician then updates the spatial
  data in ArcMap which, once finalised, is then sent to GIS staff to update into Location
  Centre. The data will be of interest to staff within PKC who are interested in identifying
  or collecting TPO data for their own professional purposes e.g. Development Management
  (planning application, LDP , supplementary guidance) and Greenspace (maintenance
  and retention of natural assets). The dataset is available for general public use,
  stakeholders or any interested party outside the Council to identify TPOs.</p>'
