  \ display:inherit;'>The primary data source for these tenure estimates is the Council\
  \ Tax Register compiled by the City Assessor. Stores, garages and properties relating\
  \ to hostels and institutions have been excluded from the total stock count. Ownership\
  \ information from this source relies to a considerable extent on residents notifying\
  \ the Council that a change of tenure has taken place. Accordingly, the figures\
  \ contained within this file may differ slightly from other estimates available\
  \ which make use of additional data sources, such as tenure data from the Housing\
  \ Benefits system, a housing stock file from the Glasgow Housing Association and\
  \ the Statutory Register of Private Landlords. These tenure estimates were last\
  \ undertaken for housing stock as it was in 2018, with the report going to Council\
  \ committee in 2019. These estimates which are aggregated to neighbourhood level\
  \ are available at:\_<a href='https://www.glasgow.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=46229&amp;p=0The'\

  ownership information from the various data sources does not always agree. This\
  \ is a particular issue for private renting. For dwellings where the available evidence\
  \ from the Council Tax Register and the Statutory Register of Private Landlords\
  \ is not consistent, a more detailed tenure assessment was carried out, using a\
  \ sample. The proportions for owner occupation and private renting from the sample\
  \ have been used to estimate the tenure for dwellings where the tenure position\
  \ is unclear.The owner occupied stock figures include shared ownership and shared\
  \ equity properties. The social rented stock figures include mid-market rent housing.\
  \ Housing at full market rent has been classified as private rented stock, irrespective\
  \ of ownership.</span><div><br /></div></p>"
