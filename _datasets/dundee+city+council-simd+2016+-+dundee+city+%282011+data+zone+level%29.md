notes: "<p>The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) is the Scottish Government\u2019\
  s official tool for identifying places in Scotland suffering from deprivation. Deprivation\
  \ in this context refers to the range of problems that arise due to the lack of\
  \ resources or opportunities covering health, safety, education, employment, housing\
  \ and access to services as well as financial aspects. </p>\n<p>The most recent\
  \ Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation was released by the Scottish Government\
  \ on 31st August 2016. The SIMD divides Scotland into 6,976 small areas called data\
  \ zones with roughly an equal population in each data zone. The Scottish Government\
  \ then look at the indicators to measure the different sides of deprivation in each\
  \ data zone including pupil performance, travel times to GP\u2019s, crime, unemployment\
  \ etc. These 38 indicators of deprivation are then grouped into 7 types called domains.\
  \ These domains are:</p>\n<p>\u2022  Income\n \u2022  Employment\n \u2022  Education\n\
  \ \u2022  Health\n \u2022  Access to Services\n \u2022  Crime\n \u2022  Housing\
  \ </p>\n<p>The 7 domains are combined into one SIMD, ranking each data zone in Scotland\
  \ from 1 (Most Deprived) to 6,976 (Least Deprived). The SIMD allows organisations\
  \ to target policies and place resources in the areas with greatest need. </p>\n\
  <p>The boundaries used to collate the SIMD changed in 2016 as the analysis was based\
  \ on the 2011 data zones which were produced by the Scottish Government.  The previous\
  \ SIMD\u2019s published by the Scottish Government were based on the Scottish Governments\
  \ 2001 based data zones. This means that the data zones used in the 2016 SIMD are\
  \ not directly comparable with previous data zones.</p>\n<p>This dataset shows SIMD\
  \ 2016 data for Dundee City. This is broken down to data zone and intermediate zone\
  \ level. There are currently 188 data zones in Dundee City.</p>\n<p>The data is\
  \ sourced from Scottish Government - Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation 2016.\
  \ The full dataset is available on the Scottish Government website which can be\
  \ accessed from the link below:\n https://www2.gov.scot/Topics/Statistics/SIMD</p>\n\
  <p>The Scottish Government have produced some useful documents to assist greater\
  \ understanding of the SIMD. \n SIMD 2016 Introduction Booklet: https://www2.gov.scot/Resource/0050/00504809.pdf</p>\n\
