notes: '<p>The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) is the Scottish Government\u2019s
  official tool for identifying places in Scotland suffering from deprivation. Deprivation
  in this context refers to the range of problems that arise due to the lack of resources
  or opportunities covering health, safety, education, employment, housing and access
  to services as well as financial aspects. \r\n\r\nThe most recent Scottish Index
  of Multiple Deprivation was released by the Scottish Government on 31st August 2016.
  The SIMD divides Scotland into 6,976 small areas called data zones with roughly
  an equal population in each data zone. The Scottish Government then look at the
  indicators to measure the different sides of deprivation in each data zone including
  pupil performance, travel times to GP\u2019s, crime, unemployment etc. These 38
  indicators of deprivation are then grouped into 7 types called domains. These domains
  are:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tIncome\r\n\u2022\tEmployment\r\n\u2022\tEducation\r\n\u2022\tHealth\r\n\u2022\tAccess
  to Services\r\n\u2022\tCrime\r\n\u2022\tHousing \r\n\r\nThe 7 domains are combined
  into one SIMD, ranking each data zone in Scotland from 1 (Most Deprived) to 6,976
  (Least Deprived). The SIMD allows organisations to target policies and place resources
  in the areas with greatest need. \r\n\r\nThe boundaries used to collate the SIMD
  changed in 2016 as the analysis was based on the 2011 data zones which were produced
  by the Scottish Government.  The previous SIMD\u2019s published by the Scottish
  Government were based on the Scottish Governments 2001 based data zones. This means
  that the data zones used in the 2016 SIMD are not directly comparable with previous
  data zones.\r\n\r\nThis dataset shows SIMD 2016 data for Dundee City. This is broken
  down to data zone and intermediate zone level. There are currently 188 data zones
  in Dundee City.\r\n\r\nThe data is sourced from Scottish Government - Scottish Index
  of Multiple Deprivation 2016. The full dataset is available on the Scottish Government
  website which can be accessed from the link below:\r\nhttps://www2.gov.scot/Topics/Statistics/SIMD\r\n\r\nThe
  Scottish Government have produced some useful documents to assist greater understanding
  of the SIMD. \r\nSIMD 2016 Introduction Booklet: https://www2.gov.scot/Resource/0050/00504809.pdf\r\n\r\nSIMD
