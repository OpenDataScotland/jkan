notes: <p>Care for women around the time they are giving birth is an essential, time
  critical service that cannot be deferred. As such, it has been provided throughout
  the COVID-19 pandemic, and maternity staff have not been redeployed to support other
  services. The way that some elements of this care are provided has changed in response
  to COVID-19 however, to minimise the risk of infection and to allow services to
  continue to provide safe care during times when a high number of staff may be off
  work, for example due to needing to isolate.\r\n\r\nGuidance issued by the Scottish
  Government and Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists to maternity services
  at the height of the first wave of the pandemic noted that:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tIt may
  be necessary for services to temporarily suspend the option for women to deliver
  at home or in midwife led units, and to concentrate delivery care within obstetric
  units.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tAdditional restrictions on the use of water births were recommended.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tCare
  pathways for women requiring induction of labour should be amended to ensure the
  early stages of the induction process were delivered on an outpatient basis wherever
  possible.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tServices should consider deferring a planned induction
  of labour or elective caesarean section if a woman was isolating due to having COVID-19,
  or having been in contact with a case, if it was safe to do so.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tServices
  should support low risk women in the early latent phase of labour to remain at home
  wherever possible.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tIn general, strict restrictions on visitors for
  patients in hospital were advised, however women giving birth could still be accompanied
  by their chosen birth partner.\r\n\r\nThe \u2018method of delivery' refers to the
  way a baby is born. Different methods of delivery include spontaneous vaginal delivery
  (a natural birth); assisted vaginal delivery (including vaginal delivery by forceps
  or ventouse, or vaginal delivery of a breech baby); or a caesarean section (an operation
  to deliver the baby through a cut in the mother\u2019s abdomen). A caesarean section
  can be elective (planned in advance and provided before labour has started) or emergency
  (unplanned, and usually but not always provided after labour has started).\r\n\r\nThis
  dataset shows information on method of delivery at Scotland and  NHS Board level.
  Age and deprivation breakdown is also available at Scotland level. \r\n\r\nThis
