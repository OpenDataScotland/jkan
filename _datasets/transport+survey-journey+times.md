notes: <p><strong>This dataset grouping details the output from transport monitoring
  within Stirling.</strong>     \r\n\r\n<strong>Outputs from the monitors feed into
  the Local Transport Strategy (LTS) which can be accessed via Stirling Council\u2019s
  <a href="https://www.stirling.gov.uk/roads-transport-streets/environment-friendly-transport/local-transport-strategy-documents/">website</a>.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Journey
  times\u2019 data are gathered using Bluetooth sensors which detect Bluetooth devices
  travelling on monitored routes.</strong>  \r\n\r\n<strong>The devices that are used
  are encrypted, and anonymise any data collected. No vehicles can be traced.</strong>
  \r\n\r\n<strong>Journey times are calculated when one device is identified at two
  locations, this is referred to as a Bluetooth match.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>The
  collection of journey times\u2019 data can be effected by different activities and
  conditions.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\u2022\tThere must be a minimum of five Bluetooth
  matches before the journey time can be generated</strong>\r\n \r\n<strong>\u2022\tRoad
  closures will skew outputs as vehicles will be using alternative routes</strong>
  \r\n\r\n<strong>\u2022\tSensors can be moved to different sites therefore results
  will be zero until the locations are updated </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\u2022\tActivity
  of the sensors can impact results. Normally the Bluetooth sensors are active between
  7am and 7pm. However, if they receive up to two weeks of insufficient sunlight there
  can be unprecedented periods of inactivity</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href="https://trafficscotland.org/">Traffic
  Scotland</a> can provide updates on any road closures and the <a href="https://www.roadworksscotland.org/">Scottish
  Roadworks Commissioner</a> can give further details on any planned roadworks throughout
  the country.</strong>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>
