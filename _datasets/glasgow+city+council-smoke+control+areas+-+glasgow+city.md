notes: '<p>Under Section 18 of the Clean Air Act 1993, many parts of Scotland are
  Smoke Control Areas. If you live in a smoke control area it is an offence to produce
  smoke from a chimney of a building, or a chimney of any fixed boiler or industrial
  plant, unless you''re burning an authorised fuel or using exempt appliances (e.g.
  burners or stoves). In practice, this means that in a smoke control area it is illegal
  to burn house coal or wood in an open fire, although it is legal to burn these in
  a stove or other appliance that has been approved to burn that fuel. It is also
  illegal to deliver any unauthorised solid fuels, e.g. wood and normal house coal,
  to any premises in a smoke control area unless the seller can demonstrate that they
  were aware that the unauthorised solid fuel is to be burnt in an exempt appliance.</p>
