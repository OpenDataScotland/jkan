  \ /></b></div>\n<div><b>Abstract\_\_</b></div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>The Development\
  \ High Risk Area is the part of the coal mining reporting area which contains one\
  \ or more recorded coal mining related features which have the potential for instability\
  \ or a degree of risk to the surface from the legacy of coal mining operations.\_\
  \ The combination of features included in this composite area includes mine entries;\
  \ shallow coal workings (recorded and probable); recorded coal mining related hazards;\
  \ recorded mine gas sites; fissures and breaklines and previous surface mining sites.\_\
  \ New development in this defined area needs to demonstrate that the development\
  \ will be safe and stable taking full account of former coal mining activities.\
  \ This area was formally known as the Development Referral Area.\_</div>\n<div><br\
  \ /></div>\n<div><b>Purpose\_\_</b></div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>The development\
  \ high risk areas have been defined to enable developers and planners to understand\
  \ and consider the potential for instability or degree of risk from the legacy of\
  \ coal mining operations.\_ This information is also provided to asset managers\
  \ for the management of the land assets of public bodies and major landowners.\_\
