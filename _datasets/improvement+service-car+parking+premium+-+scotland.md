notes: '<p>Most councils will keep a record of their car parks, bays and zones (including
  parking-related TROs (Traffic Regulation Orders). Therefore we have tried to compile
  these into consistent national layers.  Currently, we publish four layers: - Car
  Parks - a polygon layer - Car Parks - a point layer - Parking Bays - a polygon layer
  - Parking Zones - a polygon layer  Any supplied line records (usually TROs) have
  been buffered by 2m to create a representative area and incorporate them into the
  national polygon layers.  Many partially populated attributes are currently published.
  However, we will look to rationalise this list in future iterations.</p>'
