  /></p><p><span style=''font-size:12pt;''>Adopted at March 2020, the strategy provides
  a strategic framework for the development of forest and woodland in Perth and Kinross
  (2014-2024) and sets out a local interpretation of the Scottish Forestry Strategy.  It
  will be used to inform development management decisions that involve woodland creation
  and woodland removal alongside other relevant information.  The Strategy is a land
  use plan to help identify areas where proposals for woodlan</span><span style=''font-size:12pt;''>d
  creation and management may be supported and activities that will be encouraged
  through available funding.   The extent to which specific proposals in potential
  areas will be supported will depend on site specific criteria detailed with in action
  plans,  individual forest management plans, the Forest Design Framework etc.  The
  design of schemes will require careful consideration.</span></p><p style=''font-size:12pt;''><span>CLASS:</span></p><p
  style=''font-size:12pt;''><span>PREFERRED:  Land will be that which offers the greatest
  scope to accommodate future expansion of a range of woodland types, and hence, to
  deliver on a very wide range of objectives. Within preferred areas sensitivities
  are, in general, likely to be limited, and it should be possible to address any
  particular site specific issues within well designed proposals that meet the UK
  Forestry Standard and associated guidelines. Most expansion is therefore likely
  to be focused on preferred areas.</span></p><p style=''font-size:12pt;''><span>POTENTIAL:  Land
  will be that which offers considerable potential to accommodate future expansion
  of a range of woodland types, but where at least one significant sensitivity exists.
  The extent to which specific proposals in potential areas will be supported will
  depend on how well sensitivities can be addressed within the proposals. The design
  of schemes will require careful consideration</span></p><p style=''font-size:12pt;''><span>SENSITIVE:  Areas
  where a combination of sensitivities means there will be limited scope to accommodate
  further woodland expansion unless that expansion demonstrably does not impact negatively
  on the identified sensitivity. Limited woodland expansion may be possible within
  sensitive areas where it is of a scale and character which can be accommodated without
  significant negative impacts and/or where it would positively enhance the features
  of interest locally. In some areas cumulative impact may also be a relevant consideration.</span></p><p
