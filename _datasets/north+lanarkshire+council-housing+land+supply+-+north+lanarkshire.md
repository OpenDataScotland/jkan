notes: <p>Local authorities are required to conduct an annual survey of the housing
  land supply, 'the Housing Land Audit', to determine completions within the timeframe
  and update forecasts of the housing land supply. This, in turn, helps inform land
  releases within the Local Development Plan process. A five-year effective housing
  land supply is required at all times.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               </p>
