notes: <p>Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new strain of coronavirus first identified
  in Wuhan, China. Clinical presentation may range from mild-to-moderate illness to
  pneumonia or severe acute respiratory infection.\r\n\r\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has
  wider impacts on individuals\u2019 health, and their use of healthcare services,
  than those that occur as the direct result of infection. Reasons for this may include:\r\n\r\n\u2022
  Individuals being reluctant to use health services because they do not want to burden
  the NHS or are anxious about the risk of infection.\r\n\r\n\u2022 The health service
  delaying preventative and non-urgent care such as some screening services and planned
  surgery.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Other indirect effects of interventions to control COVID-19,
  such as mental or physical consequences of distancing measures.\r\n\r\nThis dataset
  provides information on trend data regarding the wider impact of the pandemic on
  the number of deaths in Scotland, derived from the National Records of Scotland
  (NRS) <a href="https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/covid19stats">weekly deaths registration
  data</a>. Data show recent trends in deaths (2020), whether COVID or non-COVID related,
  and historic trends for comparison (five-year average, 2015-2019). The recent trend
  data are shown by age group and sex, and the national data are also shown by broad
  area deprivation category (Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation, SIMD).\r\n\r\nThis
  data is also available on the <a href="https://scotland.shinyapps.io/phs-covid-wider-impact/">COVID-19
