notes: <p>Town centres are defined by local authorities to meet the requirement of
  Scottish Planning Policy (paragraph 61) to identify town centres and other retail
  locations as part of a network of centres to support retail type development in
  the most appropriate locations. This forms part of the sequential test in assessing
  planning applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </p>
