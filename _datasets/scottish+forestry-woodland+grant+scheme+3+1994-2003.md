notes: "<p>The Woodland Grant Scheme (WGS) provided incentives for people to create\
  \ and manage woodlands on sites all over Great Britain. The Forestry Commission\
  \ paid grants for establishing and looking after woodlands and forests.     To qualify\
  \ for grant the applicant must have met the standards of environmental protection\
  \ and practice set out in the Forestry Commission\u2019s guidelines.    WGS3 was\
  \ launched during September 1994 and was closed for new applications in Scotland\
  \ in February 2003. It was then replaced by the Scottish Forestry Grant Scheme (SFGS).\
  \    Updates to scheme boundaries and grant aided areas were incorporated into the\
  \ dataset on a regular basis until the end of 2012. No further changes will be made\
  \ after this time.    For more detailed information please see the metadata record\
  \ on Scotland's SpatialData.gov.scot Metadata Portal.</p>"
