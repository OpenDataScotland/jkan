notes: <p>Care for women and babies around the time they are giving birth/being born
  is an essential, time critical service that cannot be deferred. As such, it has
  been provided throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, and maternity and neonatal staff
  have not been redeployed to support other services. The way that some elements of
  this care are provided has changed in response to COVID-19 however, to minimise
  the risk of infection and to allow services to continue to provide safe care during
  times when a high number of staff may be off work, for example due to needing to
  isolate. Relevant guidance has been issued by the Scottish Government, the Royal
  College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, and the British Association for Perinatal
  Medicine.\r\n\r\n\u2018Gestation at delivery\u2019 refers to the number of completed
  weeks pregnant a woman is when she delivers her baby. Babies are \u2018due\u2019
  at 40 completed weeks gestation. Those born between 37 and 41 weeks inclusive are
  considered to be born \u2018at term\u2019. Babies born at under 37 weeks (more than
  three weeks before their due date) are considered preterm or premature, with those
  born at under 32 weeks considered very preterm and those born at 32 to 36 weeks
  inclusive considered moderately preterm. Babies born at or over 42 weeks (more than
  two weeks after their due date) are considered post-term or over-due. Babies born
  preterm are at increased risk of both short and long term health and developmental
  problems, with the risk increasing the earlier a baby is born. Babies are also at
  increased risk when pregnancies extend post-term, in particular the risk of stillbirth
  increases from 42 weeks gestation onwards.\r\n\r\nThis dataset presents information
  on gestation at delivery. Data is shown at Scotland and NHS Board level, as well
  as broken down by age group and deprivation. \r\n\r\nThis data is also available
