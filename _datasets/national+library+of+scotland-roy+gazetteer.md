notes: <p>This dataset contains records for 33,523 place names and related information
  gathered from the Roy Military Survey of Scotland (1747-55). The dataset includes
  all of the names on the Roy Military Survey, as well as place names from later Ordnance
  Survey 1st edition maps (1840s-1880s) that the Roy Map names relate to. The names
  were gathered through a crowdsourcing map transcription project by over 180 volunteers
  between February and July 2022. This was a collaborative project between the British
  Library, who hold the original Roy mapping, and the National Library of Scotland.
  About the Roy Map The Roy Military Survey of Scotland (1747-1755) is a uniquely
  important map in Scottish history and map-making. For many Highland areas, it is
  the most detailed and informative map that survives for the entire 18th century,
  whilst for all areas of the Scottish mainland, the only standard topographic map
  prior to the Ordnance Survey mapping in the 19th century. As well as being strikingly
  attractive to look at, the Roy Map is of value for researching many types of landscape
  history, including woodland, land-use, roads, settlements and antiquities. Read
  more about the Roy Map . Purpose The primary aim of the project was to record all
  of the names on the Roy Military Survey. To aid searching and to improve the links
  with later Ordnance Survey maps, the name of a place either related to or nearby
  the Roy name was also transcribed from the OS one-inch and OS six-inch to the mile
  1st edition maps (1840s-1880s). The primary value of the Roy Map Gazetteer is that
  it allows a way of searching for particular places on the Roy Map. This is extremely
  useful for local and family history purposes, as well as for toponymic and placename
  research. As the Roy Map also includes descriptive names relating to features (such
  as bays, castles, cottar towns, kirks, harbours, mills, roads, or woods), the gazetteer
  also allows distributions of these particular features to be viewed. Searching the
  Roy Map Gazetteer The Roy Map Gazetteer can be searched using a map interface .
  This allows a particular name or keyword string to be queried, and a distribution
  map of the returned records to be displayed. As the Roy Map is split into the Highlands
  and Lowlands, with an overlap between them, the map interface splits the gazetteer
  into the Highlands and Lowlands. The Roy Map Gazetteer can also be searched as a
  browsable list . This shows all of the Roy Map names as a single alphabetical sequence,
  for both the Highlands and the Lowlands Roy Map layers.</p>
