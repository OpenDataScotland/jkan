notes: '<p>The Water Intended for Human Consumption (Private Supplies) (Scotland)
  Regulations 2017 came into force in October 2017, and are regulated and enforced
  by Local Authorities.  The main objective of the Regulations is to ensure the provision
  of clean, safe drinking water and to deliver significant health benefits to those
  using private water supplies.  The DWQR has an independent role in verifying that
  the Regulations are complied with and also reports on compliance with the Regulations
  to the European Commission. Local Authorities are required to maintain a register
  of every private water supply to premises in its area.  This dataset consists of
  2 point layers;  PWS Sources: This is the locations from where the PWS originates
  from, provided by DWQR based on the LA yearly Statutory Returns  PWS properties:
  This is the location of addresses which are served by the specific PWS source.  "UPRN"
  and "address" are MANDATORY fields for both these layers in this dataset.</p>'
