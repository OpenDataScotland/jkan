notes: '<p>The Water Intended for Human Consumption (Private Supplies) (Scotland)
  Regulations 2017 came into force in October 2017, and are regulated and enforced
  by Local Authorities.  The main objective of the Regulations is to ensure the provision
  of clean, safe drinking water and to deliver significant health benefits to those
  using private water supplies.  The DWQR has an independent role in verifying that
  the Regulations are complied with and also reports on compliance with the Regulations
  to the European Commission. Local Authorities are required to maintain a register
  of every private water supply to premises in its area.  This is a dataset containing
  the locations of Private Water Supply System sources in Scotland. This dataset has
  been provided to the Drinking Water Quality Regulator (DWQR) by Local Authorities,
  who are responsible for keeping a register of the location of sources for Private
  Water Supply Systems in their area. The DWQR cannot guarantee the accuracy or completeness
  of this dataset. The dataset should be used with caution, as the locations can often
  be approximate, outdated, or wrong. The dataset is also not complete. There are
  additional Private Water Supply Systems, for which no location data has been provided
  to the DWQR. You are strongly advised to contact the Local Authorities themselves
  to get accurate and complete Private Water Supply System location data, if this
  information is to be used for any further decision making  This dataset consists
  of 2 point layers;  PWS Sources: This is the locations from where the PWS originates
  from, provided by DWQR based on the LA yearly Statutory Returns  PWS properties:
  This is the location of addresses which are served by the specific PWS source.  "UPRN"
  and "address" are MANDATORY fields for both these layers in this dataset.</p>'
