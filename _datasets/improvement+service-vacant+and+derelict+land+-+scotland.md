notes: '<p>The Scottish Vacant and Derelict Land Survey (SVDLS) is a national data
  collection undertaken to establish the extent and state of vacant and derelict land
  in Scotland. The survey has been operating since 1988. This survey is associated
  with the Scottish Vacant and Derelict Land Fund, under which cash allocations are
  made to Planning  Authorities.  Every year the Scottish Government Communities Analysis
  Division produce a National Statistics statistical publication  based on data collected
  and processed from all Local Authorities and Loch Lomond and Trossachs National
  Park Authority. This includes an SVDLS Site Register.  Where shapefiles are provided
  by Planning Authorities the Scottish Government quality assure these to make sure
  they match the published Excel SVDLS Site Register.  To create this dataset we have
  taken all of the spatial data provided by councils and checked by the Scottish Government
  for the current survey year (2021 published in 2022 for most authorities) and combined
  it to this year''s SVDLS Site Register  (using the site reference).  However: -
  where Planning Authorities have not provided spatial data for the current year,
  their previous spatial data return has been used, or derived from the polygon area
  (see below). - where there is no spatial data at all for sites we have buffered
  the easting and northing provided in the survey, to create a circular polygon area
  for a site.  The definitive data source is the SVDLS Site Register available here:
