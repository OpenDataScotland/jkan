notes: '<p>The Scottish Vacant and Derelict Land Survey is a national data collection
  undertaken to establish the extent and state of vacant and derelict land in Scotland.
  The survey has been operating since 1988. This survey is associated with the Scottish
  Vacant and Derelict Land Fund, under which cash allocations are made to local authorities.   Every
  year the Scottish Government Communities Analytical Services produce a comprehensive
  national survey based on data collected and processed from all Local Authorities
  and Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park Authority. The Spatial Hub takes this
  survey data and joins it (using site ID) to the polygon site information provided
  by local authorities.  To create this dataset we have taken all of the spatial data
  provided by councils and checked by the Scottish Government for the current survey
  year (2021 published in 2022 for most authorities) and combined it to this year''s
  statistical survey (using the site reference). However:  - where local authorities
  have not provided spatial data for the current year, their previous spatial data
  return has been used, or derived from the polygon area (see below). - where there
  is no spatial data at all for sites we have buffered the easting and northing provided
  in the survey, to create a circular polygon area for a site.   The definitive datasource
  is the Site Register available here: https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-vacant-derelict-land-survey-2021/</p>'
