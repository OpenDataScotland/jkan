notes: "<p>The Scottish Vacant and Derelict Land Survey (SVDLS) is a national data\
  \ collection undertaken to establish the extent and state of vacant and derelict\
  \ land in Scotland. The survey has been operating since 1988. This survey is associated\
  \ with the Scottish Vacant and Derelict Land Fund, under which cash allocations\
  \ are made to Planning  Authorities.</p>\n<p>Every year the Scottish Government\
  \ Communities Analysis Division produce a National Statistics statistical publication\
  \  based on data collected and processed from all Local Authorities and Loch Lomond\
  \ and Trossachs National Park Authority. This includes an SVDLS Site Register. \
  \ Where shapefiles are provided by Planning Authorities the Scottish Government\
  \ quality assure these to make sure they match the published Excel SVDLS Site Register.</p>\n\
  <p>To create this dataset we have taken all of the spatial data provided by councils\
  \ and checked by the Scottish Government for the current survey year (2022 published\
  \ in 2024 for most authorities) and combined it to this year's SVDLS Site Register\
  \ (using the site reference). \n However:\n - where Planning Authorities have not\
  \ provided spatial data for the current year, their previous spatial data return\
  \ has been used, or where there is no spatial data at all for site we have buffered\
  \ the easting and northing provided in the survey, to create a circular polygon\
  \ area for the site.</p>\n<p>The definitive data source is the SVDLS Site Register\
  \ available here: https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-vacant-derelict-land-survey-2022/</p>"
