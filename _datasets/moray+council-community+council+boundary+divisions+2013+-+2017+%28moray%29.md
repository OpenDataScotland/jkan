notes: <p>Community Councils Divisions 2013 - 2017 (Moray). The purpose of community
  councils is to ascertain, co-ordinate and express the views of the community it
  represents to local authorities and other pubic bodies. This includes community
  councils appointing one person as their point of contact for all planning matters.
  Community Councils are regularly consulted by the local authority and public bodies
  on a wide range of issues which affect their area, such as planning, environment
  and health. All Community Council meetings are open to the public.</p>
