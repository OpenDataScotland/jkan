notes: "<p>The Woodland Grant Scheme (WGS) provided incentives for people to create\
  \ and manage woodlands on sites all over Great Britain. The Forestry Commission\
  \ paid grants for establishing and looking after woodlands and forests.    To qualify\
  \ for grant the applicant must have met the standards of environmental protection\
  \ and practice set out in the Forestry Commission\u2019s guidelines.    WGS2 operated\
  \ between June 1991 and September 1994. It was replaced by WGS3    Updates to scheme\
  \ boundaries and grant aided areas were incorporated into the dataset on a regular\
  \ basis until the end of 2012. No further changes will be made after this time.\
