notes: '<p>This point dataset represents every known wind turbine over 15m (to turbine
  tip) in the country. It includes details (where known) of planning reference, height,
  number of turbines on the site.</p>

  <p>Some local authority areas (e.g. more southern) are more up-to-date than others
  (in the north). However, we will endeavour to get this dataset more complete in
  the coming months.</p>'
