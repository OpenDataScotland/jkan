notes: '<p>There are two methods of standardising: direct and indirect. \r\n\r\nBoth
  methods rely upon reference to a single standard population, which has a known population
  structure (in the case of direct standardisation) or known age-specific rates (in
  the case of indirect standardisation). The choice of standard population is important,
  as it influences the standardised rates or ratios obtained.</p>'
