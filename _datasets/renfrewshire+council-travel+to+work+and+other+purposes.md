notes: <p>Detailed statistics on what mode of transport people usually use to get
  to work and education, as well as the percentage of total journeys which people
  make for a given purpose and children's mode of travel to school (from the Scottish
  Household Survey).These estimates are from the Scottish Household Survey Travel
  Diary, which asks adult respondents about all the journeys which they made the previous
  day, as well as information about the mode, purpose, duration and length of these
  journeys. The proportion of people who travel to work by public or active travel
  is a National Indicator in the Scotland Performs framework.SHS estimates are National
  Statistics and provide figures which are representative of households and individuals
  in Scotland annually. The SHS has an annual sample size of around 10,000 individuals
  and, since 2012, has operated with a fully unclustered sample design.</p>
