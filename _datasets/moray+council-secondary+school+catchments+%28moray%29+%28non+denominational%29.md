notes: "<p>In Moray, the education authority discharges its duty to secure adequate\
  \ and efficient education for the local authority area by operating a \u201Ccatchment\
  \ area\u201D system to enable parents/carers to comply with their duty to provide\
  \ efficient education for their child(ren).\_ The zones (catchment areas) are shown\
  \ as delineated areas on maps.\_ Information on these catchment areas is available\
  \ at the Moray Council website.  Most parents of children living within the catchment\
  \ area will choose for their children to attend the designated primary and secondary\
  \ school for their catchment area.  If a parent wishes their child to be enrolled\
  \ at a school which is not the designated catchment area school for their postal\
  \ address, they must make an out-of-zone \u2018placing request\u2019.\_   </p>"
