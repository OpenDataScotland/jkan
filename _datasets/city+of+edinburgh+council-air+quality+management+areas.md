  Management Areas in the City of Edinburgh Council area. Since December 1997 each
  local authority in the UK has been carrying out a review and assessment of air quality
  in their area. This involves measuring air pollution and trying to predict how it
  will change in the next few years. The aim of the review is to make sure that the
  national air quality objectives will be achieved throughout the UK by the relevant
  deadlines. If a local authority finds any places where the objectives are not likely
  to be achieved, it must declare an Air Quality Management Area there. This area
  could be just one or two streets, or it could be much bigger.</span></p>
