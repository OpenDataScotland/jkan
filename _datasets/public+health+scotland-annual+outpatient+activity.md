notes: <p>Patients who require the medical opinion of a specialist clinician may be
  referred to an outpatient clinic for treatment or investigation. An outpatient is
  a patient who attends (outpatient attendance) a consultant or other medical clinic,
  or has an arranged meeting with a consultant or a senior member of their team outwith
  a clinic session. Outpatients are not admitted to a hospital and do not use a hospital
  bed.\r\n\r\nOutpatient attendances can be categorised as new or follow-up (return)
  attendances. Information on return appointments is only available for datasets that
  report on NHS Board of Treatment. Files reporting on the residency of patients only
  contain data for new outpatients as the ISD(S)1 data source for return outpatients
  does not contain residence information. ISD(S)1 also does not record information
  on the deprivation, age or sex of patients.\r\n\r\nA variety of operations are carried
  out in NHSScotland and, increasingly, less complex procedures are undertaken in
  an outpatient setting. For further information on these procedures, see the <a href="https://www.publichealthscotland.scot/publications/acute-hospital-activity-and-nhs-beds-information-annual/">Operations/Procedures</a>
  section of the Public Health Scotland website.\r\n\r\nFurther information on hospital
  activity can be found in the <a href="https://www.publichealthscotland.scot/publications/acute-hospital-activity-and-nhs-beds-information-annual/">recent
  annual publication</a>. \r\n\r\nThe date of the next release can be found on our
  list of forthcoming publications https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/forthcoming-publications/</p>
