notes: "<p>Trial the data: The dataset consists of the first editions of sixteen books\
  \ published by James Leslie Mitchell (1901-1935) during his lifetime under his birth\
  \ name Mitchell and the pseudonym Lewis Grassic Gibbon. The books were published\
  \ between 1928 and 1934 and include novels, collections of short stories, biographies\
  \ and accounts of exploration. Among the titles is the trilogy \u2018A Scots Quair\u2019\
  \ which consists of the novels \u2018Sunset Song\u2019 (1932), \u2018Cloud Howe\u2019\
  \ (1933) and \u2018Grey Granite\u2019 (1934). Published under the pseudonym Lewis\
  \ Grassic Gibbon it tells the life story of Chris Guthrie, a woman from the north-east\
  \ of Scotland and is widely regarded as a classic work of Scottish literature. Mitchell\
  \ was a key figure in the early 20 th century Scottish literary renaissance which\
  \ introduced modernist literary techniques to Scottish literature as well as championing\
  \ the use of the Scots language. \u2018A Scots Quair\u2019 is written in a literary\
  \ form of Scots using its rhythms and cadences to capture the land and people of\
  \ Aberdeenshire. Included in the dataset are the books he published under his birth\
  \ name James Leslie Mitchell. \_These include his first novel \u2018Stained Radiance\u2019\
  \ (1930) which is partly set in Scotland and his second novel \u2018The Thirteenth\
  \ Disciple\u2019 (1931) which has autobiographical elements. Mitchell was also a\
  \ pioneering science fiction writer with \u2018Three Go Back\u2019 and \u2018Gay\
  \ Hunter\u2019 and wrote a fictional account of the slave revolt in Rome with \u2018\
  Spartacus\u2019 (1933). His final book \u2018Nine Against the Unknown\u2019 (1934)\
  \ a collection of essays on explorers brings together his two writing identities\
  \ as it is co-credited to James Leslie Mitchell and Lewis Grassic Gibbon.</p>"
