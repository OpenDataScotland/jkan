notes: <p>Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new strain of coronavirus first identified
  in Wuhan, China. Clinical presentation may range from mild-to-moderate illness to
  pneumonia or severe acute respiratory infection. \r\n\r\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has
  wider impacts on individuals\u2019 health, and their use of healthcare services,
  than those that occur as the direct result of infection.\r\nReasons for this may
  include:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Individuals being reluctant to use health services because
  they do not want to burden the NHS or are anxious about the risk of infection.\r\n\r\n\u2022
  The health service delaying preventative and non-urgent care such as some screening
  services and planned surgery.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Other indirect effects of interventions
  to control COVID-19, such as mental or physical consequences of distancing measures.\r\n\r\nThis
  dataset provides information on trend data regarding the wider impact of the pandemic
  on Scottish Ambulance Services. Data are shown by age group, sex and broad deprivation
  category (SIMD), as well as by different levels of geographical breakdown such as
  Health Boards, Health and Social Care partnerships, and Scotland totals. \r\n\r\nPlease
  note that the source of this data is the Unscheduled Care Datamart and represents
  a sub-set of the total Scottish Ambulance service activity. Figures include emergencies,
  where a vehicle arrived at the scene of the incident, and excludes both data from
  resources which were cleared as \u2018dealt with by another vehicle\u2019 and air
  ambulance data. The figures presented in this dataset relate to incidents concerning
  both COVID-19 and non-COVID issues. \r\n\r\nThis data is also available on the <a
