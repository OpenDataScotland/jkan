  \ town to support the spatial strategy by:\n - directing development to the most\
  \ appropriate locations and supporting regeneration;\n - protecting and enhancing\
  \ the character, landscape setting and identity of the settlement; and\n - protecting\
  \ and providing access to open space.                                          \
