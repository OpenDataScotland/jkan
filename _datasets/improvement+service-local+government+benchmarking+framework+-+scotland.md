notes: "<p>The Local Government Benchmarking Framework (LGBF) brings together a wide\
  \ range of information about how all Scottish councils perform in delivering services\
  \ to local communities.</p>\n<p>It is a high-level benchmarking tool designed to\
  \ help senior management teams and elected members ask questions about key council\
  \ services.</p>\n<p>The LGBF reflects a commitment by SOLACE (Scotland) and COSLA\
  \ to develop better measurement and comparable data in order to help councils improve\
  \ services, target resources to areas of greatest impact and enhance public accountability.</p>\n\
  <p>Since 2010-11, all Scottish local authorities have worked together to report\
  \ standard information on the services they provide. This information takes the\
  \ form of indicators that measure aspects of performance (for example, how much\
  \ a service costs per user or how satisfied local people are with a service) across\
  \ all areas of local government activity.</p>\n<p>The LGBF provides high-level information\
  \ designed to encourage councils to examine why variations in cost and performance\
  \ are occurring between similar councils. The framework itself does not supply the\
  \ answers. That happens as councils engage with each other to \u2018drill down\u2019\
  \ and explore why these variations are happening (see information on \u2018family\
  \ groups\u2019 below).</p>\n<p>Publication of the LGBF forms part of each council\u2019\
  s statutory public performance reporting.</p>\n<p>For more information please visit\
