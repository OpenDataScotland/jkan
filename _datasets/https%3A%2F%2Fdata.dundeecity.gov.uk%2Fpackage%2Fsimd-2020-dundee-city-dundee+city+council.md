license: "The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) is the Scottish Government\u2019\
  s official tool for identifying places in Scotland suffering from deprivation. Deprivation\
  \ in this context refers to the range of problems that arise due to the lack of\
  \ resources or opportunities covering health, safety, education, employment, housing\
  \ and access to services as well as financial aspects.\r \r The most recent Scottish\
  \ Index of Multiple Deprivation was released by the Scottish Government in 2020.\
  \ The SIMD divides Scotland into 6,976 small areas called data zones with roughly\
  \ an equal population in each data zone. The Scottish Government then look at the\
  \ indicators to measure the different sides of deprivation in each data zone including\
  \ pupil performance, travel times to GP\u2019s, crime, unemployment etc. These 38\
  \ indicators of deprivation are then grouped into 7 types called domains. These\
  \ domains are:\r \r \u2022 Income \u2022 Employment \u2022 Education \u2022 Health\
  \ \u2022 Access to Services \u2022 Crime \u2022 Housing\r \r The 7 domains are combined\
  \ into one SIMD, ranking each data zone in Scotland from 1 (Most Deprived) to 6,976\
  \ (Least Deprived). The SIMD allows organisations to target policies and place resources\
  \ in the areas with greatest need.\r \r The boundaries used to collate the SIMD\
  \ are based on the 2011 data zones which were produced by the Scottish Government.\
  \ These are the same boundaries which were used in the 2016 SIMD. Earlier SIMD's\
  \ published before 2016 were based on the Scottish Governments 2001 based data zones.\
  \ This means that the data zones used in these publications are not comparable with\
  \ the 2020 and 2016 SIMD.\r \r This dataset shows SIMD 2020 data for Dundee City.\
  \ This is broken down to data zone and intermediate zone level. There are currently\
  \ 188 data zones in Dundee City.\r \r The data is sourced from Scottish Government\
  \ - Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation 2020. \xA9 Crown Copyright 2020. The\
  \ full dataset is available on the Scottish Government website which can be accessed\
