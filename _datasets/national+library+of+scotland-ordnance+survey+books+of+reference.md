notes: "<p>Trial the data: The Ordnance Survey Books of Reference (sometimes called\
  \ \u2018Area Books\u2019, or \u2018Parish Area Books\u2019) were published between\
  \ 1855-1882 to accompany the Ordnance Survey\u2019s 25 inch to the mile maps . They\
  \ record acreages of each land parcel shown on these maps and usually its land use\
  \ (for example, categorising this as \u2018arable\u2019, \u2018houses\u2019, \u2018\
  gardens\u2019, \u2018woodland\u2019). Collectively, they form the earliest, most\
  \ complete estimate of land-use for the inhabited parts of Scotland in the 19th\
  \ century. They also are the most complete estimate of the sizes of individual land\
  \ parcels or fields across Scotland in the 19th century. Many of the Books of Reference\
  \ record the names of the principal settlements and farms within each parish in\
  \ a gazetteer at the end of each Book, and for each place, give references to the\
  \ relevant Ordnance Survey 25 inch map these places fall on. The Books of Reference\
  \ were published for each civil parish, and they date from the time the relevant\
  \ maps were surveyed for the relevant parish. The earliest volumes relate to the\
  \ Borders and Central Belt from the late 1850s, and as the Ordnance Survey work\
  \ generally moved north and east, the latest cover Orkney and Shetland from the\
  \ late 1870s. Numbered land parcels on these Ordnance Survey 25 inch to the mile\
  \ maps, listed consecutively within each parish, are included in the relevant parish\
  \ Book of Reference. For volumes published after 1879, land-use information was\
  \ often omitted, even though this information is generally available on the published\
  \ Ordnance Survey 25 inch to the mile maps. In practice, for these volumes published\
  \ after 1879, the distinction between arable, grass and market gardens is lost,\
  \ but the maps still allow orchards, woodland and uncultivated ground to be distinguished\
  \ by symbols on the maps. Not all of the parishes of Scotland were covered by Books\
  \ of Reference. There are two important limits to their coverage: 1. The Ordnance\
  \ Survey\u2019s 25 inch to the mile maps only cover about one-third of the total\
  \ land area of Scotland: just the inhabited, cultivated regions. Upland, moorland,\
  \ and sparsely populated areas do not have Books of      Reference. The coverage\
  \ also excludes six counties surveyed before 1855 (when the decision was taken by\
  \ Ordnance Survey to adopt the 25 inch to the mile as the basic scale). These excluded\
  \ counties, without Books of      Reference are Edinburghshire, Fife, Haddingtonshire,\
  \ Kinross-shire,      Kirkcudbrightshire, Wigtownshire, and the Isle of Lewis. Land\
  \ parcels in built-up areas and settlements are also excluded. 2. From 1855-1859,\
  \ the Books of Reference were usually published as A0-sized lithographed sheets,\
  \ which could be cut and bound into booklets. These sheets cover parishes in the\
  \ following counties: Ayr, Berwick, Dumfries, Forfar (selected parishes), Lanark\
  \ (selected parishes), Linlithgow,      Peebles (selected parishes), Renfrew (selected\
  \ parishes), Roxburgh (selected parishes). These sheets were not published as Books\
  \ of Reference and so they are not in this data collection, but they can be viewed\
  \ on the Library\u2019s Ordnance Survey Books of Reference website. Related links\
