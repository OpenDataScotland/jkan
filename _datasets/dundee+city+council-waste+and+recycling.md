notes: <p>Local authorities are required to report to the Scottish Environmental Protection
  Agency (SEPA) about waste collected and managed by or on behalf of them. This is
  done through an online reporting system called WasteDataFlow (WDF). Reports are
  submitted to SEPA annually, with a submission deadline of 28 February.  \r\n\r\nLocal
  authority waste data are verified on an annual basis by the Data Unit and are used
  to help fulfill Scotland\u2019s reporting obligations to the Scottish Government
  and Europe. The data from WasteDataFlow is used to populate Scotland\u2019s Environment
  <a href="https://www.environment.gov.scot/data/data-analysis/household-waste/">Household
  Waste Data Analysis Tool</a>. The tool shows a break-down of household waste generated
  and managed by waste type for 2011 \u2013 2015 and the trends for household waste
  generated, recycled and managed since 2004. \r\n\r\nThe Scotland\u2019s Environment
  <a href="https://www.environment.gov.scot/data/data-analysis/waste-from-all-sources/">Waste
  Discover Data tool</a> presents waste from all sources, i.e. from households, the
  construction and demolition sector, and from commerce and industry. The tool shows
  a break-down of waste types for 2011 \u2013 2015 and the trend for Scottish waste
  landfilled since 2005.\r\n\r\nAll data can be exported to Excel if required.</p>
