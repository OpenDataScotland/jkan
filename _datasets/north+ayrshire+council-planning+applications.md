notes: <p>Development management is the process of deciding planning applications,
  including the appeals and review processes. Legislation defines what development
  activities require planning permission and that decisions are made in keeping with
  the Development Plan.  Development is defined in the legislation as the carrying
  out of building, engineering, mining or other operations in, on, over or under land,
  or the making of any material change in the use of any buildings or other land.
  The definition also covers changes of use which may not involve physical building
  work.</p>
