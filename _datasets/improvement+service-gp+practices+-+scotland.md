notes: <p>This dataset of the name, address, location and unique ID of every registered
  General Practitioner Practice in Scotland has initially been supplied by Geoplace.
  It takes data from the NHS open data platform (https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset)
  and matches it to current address records from the One Scotland Gazetteer. Once
  this data has been validated by local government custodians, the data will be actively
  maintained and extracted directly from the One Scotland Gazetteer.</p>
