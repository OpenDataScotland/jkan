notes: "<p>Trial the data: First World War Casualty Lists were published daily in\
  \ several national newspapers from September 1914. This ceased in August 1917 due\
  \ to paper shortage and also the effect on public morale. These lists contain the\
  \ names of British service personnel who were reported as wounded, missing, taken\
  \ prisoner of war, or killed in action. This dataset contains weekly lists from\
  \ 1917-1919, published by His Majesty\u2019s Stationery Office. Related datasets\
