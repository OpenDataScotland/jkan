notes: <p><strong>This publication was renamed on 12 October 2023 from Respiratory
  Infection Statistical Data in Scotland to Viral Respiratory Diseases (Including
  Influenza and COVID-19) Data in Scotland.  This included the addition of 11 new
  datasets</strong>.\r\n\r\nThis dataset provides information on the number and rate
  of new weekly confirmed respiratory cases (including COVID-19, influenza and other
  non-influenza respiratory pathogens) at Scotland, NHS Board and Council Area (where
  available) level.\r\n\r\nThis publication includes information on socio-demographic
  characteristics such as age, gender, and deprivation status for both cases and hospital
  admissions, along with trend data. \r\n\r\nData visualisation of Scottish COVID-19,
  influenza, and other respiratory pathogen cases is available on the\u202f<a href="https://scotland.shinyapps.io/phs-respiratory-covid-19/">Public
  Health Scotland - Covid 19 Scotland dashboard</a>. Additional information can be
  found in the data dictionary for each dataset. \r\n\r\nTracking infectious respiratory
  diseases, including COVID-19 and influenza, is essential, especially in the winter
  when the disease burden can be highest. In Scotland, respiratory infection and associated
  morbidity are monitored using enhanced surveillance. This approach combines data
  from microbiological sampling and laboratory test results from community and hospital
  settings with data from syndromic surveillance of NHS 24 calls, primary care consultations
  for respiratory symptoms, hospital (including intensive care) admissions and other
  settings. The intelligence generated from surveillance of laboratory, syndromic
  and settings provide a comprehensive picture of current respiratory illness in Scotland.
  \r\n\r\nThe key non-influenza respiratory pathogens include adenovirus, seasonal
  coronaviruses (non-COVID-19), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human parainfluenza
  virus (HPIV), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus.
  These mostly cause mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, such as the common cold,
  but infection can sometimes lead to more severe lower respiratory tract complications,
  especially in young children, the elderly and those with weakened immune systems.
  Symptoms may also include a variety of non-respiratory presentations. \r\n\r\nLatest
  COVID-19 guidance from NHS Scotland, can be found here on <a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19#stay-at-home-advice">NHS
  Inform</a>. \r\n\r\nFurther information on coronavirus in Scotland is available
  on the\u202f<a href="https://www.gov.scot/coronavirus-covid-19/">Scottish Government
  \u2013 Coronavirus in Scotland</a> page.</p>
