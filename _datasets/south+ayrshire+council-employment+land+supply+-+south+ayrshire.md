  relation to economic development in Scotland. An Employment Land Audit is produced
  to monitor the supply, take up and status of employment land in line with National
  Guidance. The audit assesses the range and choice of marketable sites and locations
  for businesses with a variety of size and quality requirements. The audit identifies
  the availability and constraints of employment land sites within the local authority.</p>
