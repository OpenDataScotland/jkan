notes: "<p>Place-names represent a fundamental geographical identifier, which also\
  \ have considerable cultural, historical and linguistic importance. Scotland had\
  \ a great tradition of publishing descriptive (long-form) gazetteers in the 19th\
  \ century.   This dataset is the GIS point format output from a project funded by\
  \ the Scottish Government in the early 2010s, to create a Definitive Place-Name\
  \ Gazetteer for Scotland, which helped meet the INSPIRE requirements for a place-name\
  \ layer. The data also forms the underlying content for the Gazetteer for Scotland\
  \ web pages: https://www.scottish-places.info/   In 2009 a workshop was run in conjunction\
  \ with the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historic Monuments of Scotland (RCAHMS)\
  \ to examine the range of gazetteers in use in Scotland, together with a broad set\
  \ of requirements. This identified a number of organisations which hold or maintain\
  \ at least 15 different gazetteers that include geographical names for Scotland.\
  \ The two most significant gazetteers were the Gazetteer for Scotland and the Ordnance\
  \ Survey 1:50000 (OS 1:50K) product \u2013 which forms the basis for this dataset.\
  \   The Gazetteer for Scotland is a descriptive gazetteer, with a modest number\
  \ (22,000) of rich entries, including a textual description and rich feature-typing.\
  \ The OS 1:50K gazetteer has long been Ordnance Survey's only place-name gazetteer,\
  \ used as part of numerous applications.  It was decided that, for this new 'definitive'\
  \ place name gazetteer, any named feature could/ should potentially be included,\
  \ but it was accepted that the list will always be incomplete.   This dataset could\
  \ be used (and potentially linked with) other datasets like the One Scotland Gazetteer\
  \ and the Historical Names gazetteer.  The methodology for this data was a combination\
  \ of automated and manual editing. Automated methods were used in feature classification\
  \ and duplicate detection. Manual editing was required both to confirm or provide\
  \ a feature classification, but also to improve the spatial referencing.  Standards\
  \ had to be adopted; for example water bodies were spatially located by a point\
  \ which approximated its centre while rivers were spatially located at their termination\
  \ and other liner features by a random point along their length. The former gives\
  \ a useful spatial reference, the latter in many cases does not.  Quality checking\
  \ suggests that 95% of points were located to 100m or better, and 5% located to\
  \ 20m or better. More than 90% of features are classified correctly, on the basis\
  \ of the evidence available</p>"
