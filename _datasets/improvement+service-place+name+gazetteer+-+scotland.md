notes: "<p>Place-names represent a fundamental geographical identifier, which also\
  \ have considerable cultural, historical and linguistic importance. Scotland had\
  \ a great tradition of publishing descriptive (long-form) gazetteers in the 19th\
  \ century. </p>\n<p>This dataset is the GIS point format output from a project funded\
  \ by the Scottish Government in the early 2010s, to create a Definitive Place-Name\
  \ Gazetteer for Scotland, which helped meet the INSPIRE requirements for a place-name\
  \ layer. The data also forms the underlying content for the Gazetteer for Scotland\
  \ web pages: https://www.scottish-places.info/ </p>\n<p>In 2009 a workshop was run\
  \ in conjunction with the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historic Monuments\
  \ of Scotland (RCAHMS) to examine the range of gazetteers in use in Scotland, together\
  \ with a broad set of requirements. This identified a number of organisations which\
  \ hold or maintain at least 15 different gazetteers that include geographical names\
  \ for Scotland. The two most significant gazetteers were the Gazetteer for Scotland\
  \ and the Ordnance Survey 1:50000 (OS 1:50K) product \u2013 which forms the basis\
  \ for this dataset. </p>\n<p>The Gazetteer for Scotland is a descriptive gazetteer,\
  \ with a modest number (22,000) of rich entries, including a textual description\
  \ and rich feature-typing. The OS 1:50K gazetteer has long been Ordnance Survey's\
  \ only place-name gazetteer, used as part of numerous applications.</p>\n<p>It was\
  \ decided that, for this new 'definitive' place name gazetteer, any named feature\
  \ could/ should potentially be included, but it was accepted that the list will\
  \ always be incomplete. </p>\n<p>This dataset could be used (and potentially linked\
  \ with) other datasets like the One Scotland Gazetteer and the Historical Names\
  \ gazetteer.</p>\n<p>The methodology for this data was a combination of automated\
  \ and manual editing. Automated methods were used in feature classification and\
  \ duplicate detection. Manual editing was required both to confirm or provide a\
  \ feature classification, but also to improve the spatial referencing.</p>\n<p>Standards\
  \ had to be adopted; for example water bodies were spatially located by a point\
  \ which approximated its centre while rivers were spatially located at their termination\
  \ and other liner features by a random point along their length. The former gives\
  \ a useful spatial reference, the latter in many cases does not.</p>\n<p>Quality\
  \ checking suggests that 95% of points were located to 100m or better, and 5% located\
  \ to 20m or better. More than 90% of features are classified correctly, on the basis\
  \ of the evidence available</p>"
