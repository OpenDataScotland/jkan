notes: '<p>Inpatients refer to people who are admitted to an available staffed bed
  in a hospital (either electively or as an emergency) and either: remain overnight
  whatever the original intention; or are expected to remain overnight but are discharged
  earlier. Day cases refer to episodes where a person makes a planned admission to
  an available staffed bed in a hospital for clinical care, and requires the use of
  a bed (or trolley in lieu of a bed). For the purposes of national data, a day case
  episode refers to a patient who is admitted as a day case and is discharged on the
  same day as planned.\r\n\r\nFor further information on procedures, see the <a href="https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/acute-hospital-activity-and-nhs-beds-information-annual/">Operations/Procedures</a>
  section of the Public Health Scotland website.\r\n\r\nFurther information on outpatient
  activity can be found in the <a href="https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/acute-hospital-activity-and-nhs-beds-information-annual/">recent
  annual publication</a>. \r\n\r\nThe date of the next release can be found on our
