notes: '<p>Local Nature Reserves are areas of (at least) locally important natural
  heritage, designated and managed by local authorities to give people better opportunities
  to learn about and enjoy nature close to where they live. They are found across
  the country, but generally close to towns and cities.\r\nMore details are available
  here: https://www.nature.scot/professional-advice/protected-areas-and-species/protected-areas/local-designations/local-nature-reserves\r\nWhere
  we have not been supplied with data by local authorities we are extracting it from
  a previously produced NatureScot national dataset.\r\n\r\nSite name, designation
  date, website URL (for more information) and PA code are all mandatory attributes
  for this dataset now.</p>'
