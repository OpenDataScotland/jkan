  Connected Nations Report by Ofcom. Data collected and analysed from major fixed
  telecoms operators (BT, Virgin, Sky, Talk Talk, Vodafone and KCOM). Contains Broadband
  Coverage from the operators aggregated at 2011 Census output area level (SNS Datazones).
  The coverage data was collected as a snapshot in January 2018. Due to variations
  in broadband performance over time, the file should not be regarded as a definitive
  and fixed view of the UK's fixed broadband infrastructure. However, the information
  provided in this file may be useful in identifying variations in broadband availability.
