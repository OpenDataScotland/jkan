notes: '<p>Every local authority and National Park authority (access authorities)
  in Scotland is required to draw up a plan for a system of paths (core paths) sufficient
  for the purpose of giving the public reasonable access throughout their area. </p>

  <p>Core paths are paths, waterways or any other means of crossing land to facilitate,
  promote and manage the exercise of access rights under the Land Reform (Scotland)
  Act 2003, and are identified as such in access authority core paths plan.</p>

  <p>There are, intentionally, no set physical standards for core paths. This means
  that core paths can physically be anything from a faint line across a field to a
  fully constructed path, track or pavement. The National Access Forum, Scottish Natural
  Heritage and Scottish Government are encouraging information to be surveyed and
  made publicly available, in a nationally-standardised form, so that the public will
  know what physical type of route they can expect. Government guidance is making
  core paths the priority for rolling out this national standardised grading system
  information, which is set out at http://www.pathsforall.org.uk/pfa/creating-paths/path-grading-system.html                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 </p>'
