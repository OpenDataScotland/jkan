notes: <p>All local authorities will receive planning applications for renewable energy
  sites. Some local authorities have provided us with such data, from which we have
  selected only approved and/ or operational sites.  We have also received separate
  files of data showing renwable energy sites - both as point and polygon, and we
  have attempted to merge all of this data together to form a national dataset.</p>
