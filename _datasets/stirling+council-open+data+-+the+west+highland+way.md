notes: "<p><b>This dataset is published as Open Data</b><div><br /></div><div><div>The\
  \ West Highland Way stretches 96 miles (154 Km) from Milngavie to Fort William,\
  \ taking in a huge variety of scenery along the way, from countryside parks to loch-shores\
  \ and open moorlands to steep mountains.</div><div><br /></div><div>Normally the\
  \ route is completed from south to north, the thinking behind this being the southern\
  \ stages are easier and will prepare you for the more demanding northern stages.</div><div><br\
  \ /></div><div>Due to the variety of distances involved, these sections should not\
  \ necessarily be considered as a day\u2019s activity. Planning of stage lengths\
  \ should be based upon ability and fitness and the opportunities available to explore\
  \ places of interest along the route.</div></div></p>"
