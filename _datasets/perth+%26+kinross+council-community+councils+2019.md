  adopted in November 2019. Also includes a minor change made in January 2020. A Community
  Council is a voluntary organisation set up by statute by the Local Authority and
  run by local residents to act on behalf of its area. As the most local tier of elected
  representation, Community Councils play an important role in local democracy. Some
  Community Councils are "not established " or "inactive" so have no representation.
