  <p>Local government in Scotland comprises 32 unitary local authorities (council
  areas), which are divided into wards for electoral purposes. There are currently
  a total of 1,226 councillors elected from 355 wards - with each Mainland ward returning
  3 or 4 councillors. Island wards may have 1 or 2 member wards. Boundaries Scotland
  is responsible for recommendations on the definition of ward boundaries, however,
  the definitive dataset is delineated by Ordnance Survey for inclusion in their BoundaryLine
  product.
