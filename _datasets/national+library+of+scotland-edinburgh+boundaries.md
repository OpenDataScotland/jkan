notes: "<p>This dataset contains a selection of traced boundaries relating to Edinburgh,\
  \ including the boundaries of\_landownership (1804-1817),\_Police Wards (1822-1848),\_\
  Sanitary Districts (1864-1880),\_Municipal Wards (1852-1902), and\_Registration\
  \ Districts (1865-1902).  These boundaries were traced by the\_Visualising Urban\
  \ Geographies\_project, 2009-11. It also includes the extensions of the Royalty\
  \ Boundary from 1685 to 1885, and Bartholomew\u2019s\_Chronological Map of Edinburgh\_\
  (1919). Edinburgh Royalty of the City expansion (1685-1885) This data is visualised\
  \ on\_the map of 1885 by W. &amp; A.K. Johnston\_and shows the expansion of the\
  \ area controlled by the Edinburgh Town Council (the Royalty of the City of Edinburgh)\
  \ from 1685 to 1885. The Ancient Royalty was the term for the Old Town and was the\
  \ relatively small, darkly-coloured areas at the upper (western) end of the Royal\
  \ Mile. The large yellow-coloured area was predominantly acquired in 1767, and 1809,\
  \ but with important exceptions that influenced developments. Chronological Map\
  \ of Edinburgh (1919) This data is visualised on the\_map of 1919 by J.G. Bartholomew\_\
  uses different colours to indicate the dates of the city\u2019s expansion: with\
  \ a red tint used for \u2018Old and Medieval Edinburgh\u2019, i.e. before 1750;\
  \ blue for \u2018Renaissance\u2019 i.e. neo-classical Edinburgh, 1750-1850; and\
  \ brown for \u2018Modern\u2019 Edinburgh, 1850 to 1919, with shades of these colours\
  \ indicating shorter periods within these broad ones. Land-ownership boundaries\
  \ (1804-1817) This data is of landownership boundaries from two early 19th century\
  \ maps of Edinburgh: John Ainslie\u2019s 1804 map and Robert Kirkwood\u2019s plan\
  \ of 1817 . Police Wards (1822-1848) The Police Commission was first established\
  \ by the 1805 Police Act with six electoral wards in Edinburgh. The number and arrangement\
  \ of wards was revised by subsequent Police Acts in 1812 (26 wards), 1822 (30 wards),\
  \ and 1832 (32 wards). Police Commissioners had wide-ranging powers relating to\
  \ public health, with responsibilities for water, gas, lighting, building regulations,\
  \ and sanitary policies. Their administrative roles in public health were absorbed\
  \ partly by the Town Council and the wards were replaced by new Sanitary Districts\
  \ and Municipal Wards. Sanitary Districts (1864-1880) In 1863-64, Henry D. Littlejohn,\
  \ Medical Officer of Health for Edinburgh (1864-1908), created 19 sanitary districts\
  \ as an improved basis for understanding the mortality and morbidity of the city.\
  \ This spatial framework and its boundaries accorded closely with contemporary understandings\
  \ of the social and cultural topography of Edinburgh. Municipal Wards (1852-1902)\
  \ The Police Commissioners and Town Council were merged in 1856, and the municipal\
  \ boundary was extended to coincide with the parliamentary boundary. Municipal wards\
  \ were revised at regular times over the following half-century. The complex and\
  \ confused earlier boundaries were simplified, and all were revised in 1882. Thereafter,\
  \ there were further extensions and additions. Registration Districts (1865-1902)\
  \ The Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages (Scotland) Act 1854 provided\
  \ for the division of Scotland into registration districts. Registrars were appointed\
  \ in each district to maintain the registers of births, deaths and marriages. Registration\
  \ Districts were based on the parishes and burghs but some of these units were divided\
  \ and others united to form new districts. Within Edinburgh, the City Parish was\
  \ divided initially into five Registration Districts, which grew to seven by 1902.\
