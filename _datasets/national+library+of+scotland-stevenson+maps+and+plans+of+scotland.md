notes: "<p>This dataset contains records of 2,147 maps and plans of Scotland held\
  \ in the archive of the Stevenson engineering firm. This includes maps and plans\
  \ made by the Stevensons themselves and those acquired from other sources and held\
  \ with the company\u2019s archives. Although the company worked all over the world,\
  \ this resource is limited to material relating to Scottish projects and places.\
  \ The Stevenson Engineers Founded by Robert Stevenson in the late-eighteenth century,\
  \ the Edinburgh-based Stevenson engineering firm worked on projects throughout the\
  \ nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries across the world. Multiple members of\
  \ the family served as engineers to the Northern Lighthouse Board, responsible for\
  \ the Scottish lighthouse service, and took on other work including harbour improvements,\
  \ railway and canal route surveys, bridge design and the development of lenses,\
  \ signals and lights. They were involved in scientific societies, including the\
  \ Royal Society of Edinburgh, the Royal Scottish Society of Arts and the Institution\
  \ of Civil Engineers and published academic papers in fields as varied as meteorology,\
  \ optics, geology, oceanography, and engineering history. View further information\
  \ on the Stevenson Engineers The Maps and Plans The Stevenson archive of maps and\
  \ plans is diverse in subject matter, extent and purpose, representing the variety\
  \ of uses engineers had for mapping. The archive includes manuscript and printed\
  \ material at a wide range of scales. Some towns or regions are covered by multiple\
  \ plans due to the collection of reference plans, ongoing work by the Stevensons\
  \ or multiple plans relating to a single project. Recurring projects tended to include\
  \ harbours and lighthouses, while major cities or geographical features such as\
  \ the River Tay were often featured in multiple projects. The earlier part of the\
  \ archive includes a wider variety of project types. Plans of railways, roads and\
  \ bridges, for example, mostly date from before 1850. The majority of records relate\
  \ to harbour works, followed bridges and rivers. Lighthouse plans are a relatively\
  \ small proportion of the archive \u2013 around 5% of the total number of records.\
  \ View further information on the Stevenson maps and plans The Data This dataset\
  \ is based on an inventory donated by D. Alan Stevenson alongside the maps and plans\
  \ in the 1950s. Additional maps and plans relating to the Stevenson engineers were\
  \ acquired in the 1990s and catalogued separately. These two inventories were combined\
  \ and structured before being georeferenced and made available through a map-based\
  \ digital finding aid as part of a project in the summer of 2019. During this project,\
  \ some reformatting and enhancement of the data took place. Date, person, and subject\
  \ were extracted from existing descriptions for some records, which often mentioned\
  \ these collectively. In addition to the data provided by the inventories, a conservation\
  \ review of the Stevenson collection recorded additional data such as size and medium\
  \ of items. The dataset now includes, at a minimum, metadata for shelfmark, item\
  \ description, subject/theme, date, and place/location where this data was included\
  \ in the original inventories. Geographic polygon features were the assigned to\
  \ each record using a desktop GIS to enable map-based searching. Zoomable digitised\
  \ images of around 1100 of the maps and plans were added to this resource in November\
  \ 2020. This dataset was created by Rachel Dishington (University of Edinburgh)\
  \ as part of a PhD placement with the National Library of Scotland. Related links\
