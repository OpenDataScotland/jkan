notes: "<p>Woodland Creation formed part of the Scottish Rural Development Programme\
  \ (SRDP) 2007 - 2013. This SRDP was a programme of economic, environmental and social\
  \ measures, utilising some \u20AC680m of European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development\
  \ funding plus Scottish Government match funding. This programme was designed to\
  \ support rural Scotland from 2007 to 2013. Individuals and groups were able to\
  \ seek funding to help deliver the Government's strategic objectives in rural Scotland.\
  \    Woodlands are a vital sustainable natural resource and funding aims to encourage\
  \ the creation of new woodlands with grants that will contribute to the cost of\
  \ their establishment.    Within Rural Priorities there are eight woodland creation\
  \ options.    Productive conifer woodland (low cost) Productive conifer woodland\
  \ (high cost) Productive broadleaved woodland Native Woodlands Naturally regenerated\
  \ native woodland Mixed conifer/broadleaf woodland Northern &amp; Western Isles\
  \ Native Woodland Central Scotland Mixed Woodland    The woodland creation boundary\
  \ polygons in this dataset represent the total area covered by a single application\
  \ and may encompass several different planting options and claim years.    More\
  \ details on specific options within a case can be found in the Woodland Creation\
  \ Options - RDC dataset.    For more detailed information please see the metadata\
  \ record on Scotland's SpatialData.gov.scot Metadata Portal.   </p>"
