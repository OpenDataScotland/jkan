notes: "<p>The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) is the Scottish Government\u2019\
  s official tool for identifying places in Scotland suffering from deprivation. Deprivation\
  \ in this context refers to the range of problems that arise due to the lack of\
  \ resources or opportunities covering health, safety, education, employment, housing\
  \ and access to services as well as financial aspects.</p>\n<p>The most recent Scottish\
  \ Index of Multiple Deprivation was released by the Scottish Government in 2020.\
  \ The SIMD divides Scotland into 6,976 small areas called data zones with roughly\
  \ an equal population in each data zone. The Scottish Government then look at the\
  \ indicators to measure the different sides of deprivation in each data zone including\
  \ pupil performance, travel times to GP\u2019s, crime, unemployment etc. These 38\
  \ indicators of deprivation are then grouped into 7 types called domains. These\
  \ domains are:</p>\n<p>\u2022 Income \u2022 Employment \u2022 Education \u2022 Health\
  \ \u2022 Access to Services \u2022 Crime \u2022 Housing</p>\n<p>The 7 domains are\
  \ combined into one SIMD, ranking each data zone in Scotland from 1 (Most Deprived)\
  \ to 6,976 (Least Deprived). The SIMD allows organisations to target policies and\
  \ place resources in the areas with greatest need.</p>\n<p>The boundaries used to\
  \ collate the SIMD are based on the 2011 data zones which were produced by the Scottish\
  \ Government. These are the same boundaries which were used in the 2016 SIMD. Earlier\
  \ SIMD's published before 2016 were based on the Scottish Governments 2001 based\
  \ data zones. This means that the data zones used in these publications are not\
  \ comparable with the 2020 and 2016 SIMD.</p>\n<p>This dataset shows SIMD 2020 data\
  \ for Dundee City. This is broken down to data zone and intermediate zone level.\
  \ There are currently 188 data zones in Dundee City.</p>\n<p>The data is sourced\
