notes: '<p>The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) is the Scottish Government\u2019s
  official tool for identifying places in Scotland suffering from deprivation. Deprivation
  in this context refers to the range of problems that arise due to the lack of resources
  or opportunities covering health, safety, education, employment, housing and access
  to services as well as financial aspects.\r\n\r\nThe most recent Scottish Index
  of Multiple Deprivation was released by the Scottish Government in 2020. The SIMD
  divides Scotland into 6,976 small areas called data zones with roughly an equal
  population in each data zone. The Scottish Government then look at the indicators
  to measure the different sides of deprivation in each data zone including pupil
  performance, travel times to GP\u2019s, crime, unemployment etc. These 38 indicators
  of deprivation are then grouped into 7 types called domains. These domains are:\r\n\r\n\u2022
  Income \u2022 Employment \u2022 Education \u2022 Health \u2022 Access to Services
  \u2022 Crime \u2022 Housing\r\n\r\nThe 7 domains are combined into one SIMD, ranking
  each data zone in Scotland from 1 (Most Deprived) to 6,976 (Least Deprived). The
  SIMD allows organisations to target policies and place resources in the areas with
  greatest need.\r\n\r\nThe boundaries used to collate the SIMD are based on the 2011
  data zones which were produced by the Scottish Government. These are the same boundaries
  which were used in the 2016 SIMD. Earlier SIMD''s published before 2016 were based
  on the Scottish Governments 2001 based data zones. This means that the data zones
  used in these publications are not comparable with the 2020 and 2016 SIMD.\r\n\r\nThis
  dataset shows SIMD 2020 data for Dundee City. This is broken down to data zone and
  intermediate zone level. There are currently 188 data zones in Dundee City.\r\n\r\nThe
  data is sourced from Scottish Government - Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation
  2020. \xa9 Crown Copyright 2020. The full dataset is available on the Scottish Government
  website which can be accessed from the link below: \r\nhttps://www.gov.scot/collections/scottish-index-of-multiple-deprivation-2020/\r\n\r\nThere
