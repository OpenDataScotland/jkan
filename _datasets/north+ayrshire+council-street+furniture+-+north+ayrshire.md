notes: "<p>In November 2004, Audit Scotland published a document entitled \"Maintaining\
  \ Scotland's Roads\", effectively introducing a requirement on local authorities\
  \ in Scotland to produce a Roads Asset Management Plan (RAMP). Following this publication,\
  \ The Society of Chief Officers for Transportation in Scotland (SCOTS) produced\
  \ a common asset management framework through which all local authorities could\
  \ develop their own RAMP. Street assets/ furniture are a key part of the RAMP and\
  \ as such a requirement exists for a national dataset of information. This can include\
  \ (although is not limited to) features such as bollards, road signs, barriers,\
  \ parking bays, bus shelters, cattle grids, gates, street lighting columns, benches\
  \ or seats, information boards, dog/ litter/ grit bins, cycle stands, ticket machines\
  \ etc. etc.\n We are currently only including furniture types that have been provided\
  \ by more than one council. These are:\n Grit Bins\n Street Lights\n Traffic Calming\n\
  \ Traffic Signals\n Litter Bins\n Cattle Grids\n Weather Stations\n Dog Litter Bins\n\
  \ Benches\n Bollards\n Picnic Tables\n Memorials\n Cycle parking</p>\n<p>We understand\
  \ that some local authorities are loading this data into the VAULT system. We will\
  \ work with the team managing that system to ensure that there is one definitive\
  \ list in the future.</p>"
