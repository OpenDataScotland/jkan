notes: <p>This data set contains Dundee City population projections. The data is sourced
  from National Records of Scotland Sub National Population Projections - Population
  Projections for Scottish Areas publication. \r\n\r\nThe most recent publication
  is the Population Projections for Scottish Areas (2018 based) which was published
  by National Records of Scotland in March 2020.\r\n\r\nThe data set contains population
  projections for the period 2018 to 2043. Although National Records of Scotland have
  published population projections up to 2043 they have generally only commented on
  the period 2018-2028 in their analysis. Projections up to 2043 have limitations
  in their use due to the level of uncertainty with projecting this far ahead. \r\n\r\nThe
  full National Records of Scotland publication can be accessed through the following
