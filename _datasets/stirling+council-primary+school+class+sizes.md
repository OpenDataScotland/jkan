notes: <p><strong>As part of the annual pupil census, normally carried out in September,
  the Scottish Government collects and publishes data on class sizes from every local
  authority primary school across the country. Due to the wide variation in pupil
  numbers across subjects, similar data are not available for secondary schools.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>This
  group contains the datasets for the Stirling Council area, sourced from the <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/primary-school-class-sizes/">primary
  school class sizes</a>\u2019 data on the <a href="https://www.gov.scot/">Scottish
  Government</a>\u2019s website.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Visit Stirling Council's
