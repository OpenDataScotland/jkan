  They have published a short guide to your rights under FOI, entitled Your Right
  To Know - A Guide to FOI in Scotland and you can find out more about your rights
  in the Your Rights section of the website. They also maintain a series of more detailed
  briefings on exemptions and key concepts which can be found at the briefings and
