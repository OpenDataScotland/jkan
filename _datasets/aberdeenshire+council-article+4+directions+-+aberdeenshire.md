notes: '<p>An Article 4 Direction is a statement made under The Town and Country Planning
  (General Permitted Development) (Scotland) Amendment Order 2011. The Direction,
  made by a local authority and approved by Scottish Ministers, removes all or some
  of the permitted development rights on an area.</p>

  <p>The effect of a Direction is that planning permission will be required for specific
  types of development which would otherwise be regarded as ''permitted development'',
  i.e. development that does not require a planning application. Directions can cover
  a variety of minor works and might include: the replacement of doors and windows,
  the erection of gates, fences, garages, sheds, porches, storage tanks or the installation
  of satellite antennae.</p>

  <p>Article 4 Directions complement Conservation Areas and may overlap these. This
  dataset should be used alongside Conservation Areas when considering built environment
  heritage constraints on development.</p>'
