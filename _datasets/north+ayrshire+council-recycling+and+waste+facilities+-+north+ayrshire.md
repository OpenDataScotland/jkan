notes: '<p>Most councils will keep a record of their recycling and waste management
  facilities. Therefore we have tried to compile these into a consistent national
  layer.</p>

  <p>The layer contains Recycling Places (including locations of bins and centres)
  and Waste Management Sites (including transfer centres and current/historic landfill
  sites). Both are a point layer (any provided polygons will have a centroid created).</p>'
