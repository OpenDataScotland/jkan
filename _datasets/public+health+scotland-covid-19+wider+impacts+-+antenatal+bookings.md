notes: <p>As an essential service, maternity care including \u2018booking\u2019 has
  been provided throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, and women have been encouraged to
  attend all their scheduled antenatal appointments. However, how some elements of
  maternity care are delivered has changed in order to minimise the number of visits
  women need to make. The \u2018booking\u2019 appointment is the first main appointment
  a woman has with her local maternity service once she knows she is pregnant. At
  the booking appointment, women are assessed by a midwife who can then tailor the
  subsequent care they receive during their pregnancy to their particular preferences
  and needs. Women are encouraged to book before they are 13 weeks pregnant, and ideally
  before they are 10 weeks pregnant. \r\n\r\nIn general, prior to COVID-19, women
  were offered an initial in-person booking appointment (including various face to
  face tests such as blood tests and blood pressure monitoring) then a follow up appointment
  for their early pregnancy ultrasound scan. Since March 2020, in many areas women
  have been offered an initial remote consultation, then an in-person \u2018one stop\u2019
  follow up appointment for all their face to face tests and their scan.\r\n\r\nThis
  dataset shows the number of women booking for antenatal care in each week from the
  week beginning 1 April 2019 onwards. In addition to the weekly data, monthly data
  (based on exact month of booking rather than summation of sequential weeks) is presented
  for each NHS Board of residence, including the Island Boards. Due to small numbers,
  weekly data is not shown for individual Island Boards of residence (NHS Orkney,
  NHS Shetland, and NHS Western Isles), however the Island Boards are included in
  the Scotland total.\r\n\r\nThis data is also available on the <a href="https://scotland.shinyapps.io/phs-covid-wider-impact/">COVID-19
