notes: "<p>Trial the data: This collection consists of the complete runs of two Edinburgh\
  \ journals, \u2018The Attempt\u2019 (10 volumes, 1865-74) and its successor \u2018\
  The Ladies\u2019 Edinburgh Magazine\u2019 (6 volumes, 1875-80). These publications\
  \ were produced by a leading Edinburgh women\u2019s club, known during the period\
  \ as the Edinburgh Essay Society or the Ladies\u2019 Edinburgh Essay Society, but\
  \ subsequently as the Ladies\u2019 Edinburgh Debating Society. The Society existed\
  \ from 1865 to 1935. The Society\u2019s members included women who were or would\
  \ go on to be prominent figures in education, suffrage, health and welfare, including\
  \ its founder Sarah Siddons Mair and anti-slavery campaigner Eliza Wigham. They\
  \ included several published authors as well as founders and early headmistresses\
  \ of Edinburgh schools and colleges. The magazines\u2019 contents reflect their\
  \ interests in these areas, containing articles about aspects of society including\
  \ women\u2019s work, women\u2019s suffrage and rights, and religion, as well as\
  \ literary criticism, fiction and poetry. Articles by women writers who were not\
  \ members, such as Charlotte M. Yonge, also appeared occasionally. Many of the members\
  \ who contributed to the magazines were also members of the Edinburgh Ladies\u2019\
  \ Educational Association, later the Edinburgh Association for the Higher Education\
  \ of Women, and women\u2019s access to higher education was debated in these journals,\
  \ as well as facilitated by articles such as lists of examination questions. Virginia\
  \ Woolf wrote of \u2018a room of one\u2019s own\u2019 for private writing: these\
  \ publications show how this group of Edinburgh women created a communal room in\
  \ which they could speak and write to one another. As magazines which circulated\
  \ primarily to members but which could also be bought at commercial outlets, they\
  \ occupied a space at once private and public in a way which mirrored the experiences\
  \ of the Society\u2019s members during these years as they emerged from family drawing\
  \ rooms into a wider public sphere of action. These copies of the journals were\
  \ presented to the Library in 1936 along with the manuscript minutes of the society,\
  \ MSS.1723-33 , and a copy of the Society\u2019s history, \u2018Ladies in Debate\u2019\
  \ ed. Lettice Milne Rae, (Edinburgh, 1936), Shelfmark R.251.d , when the Society\
  \ was formally dissolved. Related links K.A. Kelman. \u2018Female \u2018Self Culture\u2019\

  \ tables).</p>"
