notes: "<p>This dataset identifies Forest Plans approved during Rural Development\
  \ Contracts \u2013Rural Priorities 2007-2013. \_Forest Plans aim to deliver long-term\
  \ environmental benefits through sustainable forest management and consists of a\
  \ strategic plan describing the major forest operations over a 20 year period. \
  \   Support was given to help prepare a Forest Plan through the SRDP's Woodland\
  \ Improvement Grant (WIG) for long-term forest planning. An approved Forest Plan\
  \ will give a 10 year approval for felling, thinning and will provide the means\
  \ of accessing grants for restructuring felling and regeneration and other grant\
  \ support.    This dataset stores information on the Forest Plan boundary, the 1st\
  \ and 2nd clearfell phases (1-5 years and 6-10 years) and areas managed under Low\
  \ Impact Silvicultural Systems (LISS).    Basic attribute information is captured\
  \ during the digitising process. This is subsequently joined to more comprehensive\
  \ information which is entered in an Excel spreadsheet by Scottish Forestry Conservancy\
  \ staff.    For more detailed information please see the metadata record on Scotland's\
  \ SpatialData.gov.scot Metadata Portal.</p>"
