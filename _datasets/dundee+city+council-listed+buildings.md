notes: <p>Buildings are listed by Historic Scotland for their special architectural
  or historic interest on behalf of the Scottish Government. The aim of listing such
  buildings is to protect or enhance their special character by affording them statutory
  protection. The principles for listing buildings are fairly complex and there is
  no right of appeal against the Scottish Governments decision to list a property.
  Listed buildings are listed in 3 categories - A, B and C;\r\n\r\n<em> <strong>Category
  A</strong> listed buildings are of national or international importance. \r\n</em>
  <strong>Category B</strong> listed buildings are of regional importance. \r\n* <strong>Category
  C</strong> buildings are of local importance. \r\n\r\nA building's listing covers
  its interior, exterior and any object or structure fixed to a building or which
  falls within the curtilage of such a building, forming part of the land since before
  1 July 1948.\r\n\r\nVisit the Council website for information about <a href="Further
  information on listed buildings can be found on the">listed buildings and the planning
  process</a>.  You can also visit <a href="https://www.historicenvironment.scot/advice-and-support/listing-scheduling-and-designations/listed-buildings/search-for-a-listed-building/">Historic
