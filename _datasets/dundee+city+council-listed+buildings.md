notes: '<p>Buildings are listed by Historic Scotland for their special architectural
  or historic interest on behalf of the Scottish Government. The aim of listing such
  buildings is to protect or enhance their special character by affording them statutory
  protection. The principles for listing buildings are fairly complex and there is
  no right of appeal against the Scottish Governments decision to list a property.
  Listed buildings are listed in 3 categories - A, B and C;</p>

  <ul>

  <li><strong>Category A</strong> listed buildings are of national or international
  importance. </li>

  <li><strong>Category B</strong> listed buildings are of regional importance. </li>

  <li><strong>Category C</strong> buildings are of local importance. </li>

  </ul>

  <p>A building''s listing covers its interior, exterior and any object or structure
  fixed to a building or which falls within the curtilage of such a building, forming
  part of the land since before 1 July 1948.</p>
