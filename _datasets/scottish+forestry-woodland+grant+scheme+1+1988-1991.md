notes: "<p>The Woodland Grant Scheme (WGS) provided incentives for people to create\
  \ and manage woodlands on sites all over Great Britain.    The Forestry Commission\
  \ paid grants for establishing and looking after woodlands and forests. To qualify\
  \ for grant the applicant must have met the standards of environmental protection\
  \ and practice set out in the Forestry Commission\u2019s guidelines.    WGS1 operated\
  \ between June 1988 and June 1991.    Updates to scheme boundaries and grant aided\
  \ areas were incorporated into the dataset on a regular basis until the end of 2004.\
  \ No further changes will be made after this time.    For more detailed information\
  \ please see the metadata record on Scotland's SpatialData.gov.scot Metadata Portal.</p>"
