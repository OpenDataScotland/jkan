notes: "<p>The SVDLS for Glasgow, catalogues sites that are technically vacant, conforming\
  \ to the criteria for vacant and derelict land, as set down in the SVDLS guidance,\
  \ set up in conjunction with the Scottish Government. This data set shows the survey\
  \ current year results for the City of Glasgow. Information includes the Local Authority\
  \ site code, the site type, site size in hectares, the predominant owner of the\
  \ site and the period the site became vacant or derelict. The survey is used primarily\
  \ for strategic planning and monitoring purposes, but please note the following:\
  \ the information has been compiled from a number of sources but no responsibility\
  \ is accepted for errors or omissions; also inclusion does not commit the owner,\
  \ public or private to selling land. In addition, where no planning permission exists,\
  \ inclusion does not pre-empt any decision by the Council in relation to the principle\
  \ of development on that site; nor offers any guarantee of its actual fitness for\
  \ any specific use, in physical or policy terms, and in particular, the inclusion\
  \ of a site does not pre-empt any decision by the Council in relation to the acceptability\
  \ of development on the site.<div><br /></div><div>More info at:\_<a href='https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-vacant-and-derelict-land-survey---site-register/'\
