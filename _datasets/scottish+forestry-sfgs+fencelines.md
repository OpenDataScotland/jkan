notes: "<p>The Scottish Forestry Grant Scheme (SFGS) - encouraged the creation and\
  \ management of woods and forests to provide economic, environmental and social\
  \ benefits.\_ This dataset identifies deer fences from SFGS.  Following publication\
  \ of the Scottish Executive\u2019s Scottish Forestry Strategy 'Forests for Scotland'\
  \ the opportunity was taken to review the Woodland Grant Scheme and the Farm Woodland\
  \ Premium Scheme and give them a greater Scottish focus.     The Scottish Forestry\
  \ Grant Scheme (SFGS) - encouraged the creation and management of woods and forests\
  \ to provide economic, environmental and social benefits.    Grants were available\
  \ under three main areas:    Grants for woodland expansion - creating new woodlands.Restocking\
  \ grants, for replanting following felling.Stewardship grants, for a range of activities\
  \ in existing woodlands.    Applications for SFGS grants started in June 2003 and\
  \ closed in August 2006.     Most grants for SFGS were based on a percentage of\
  \ Standard Costs of agreed operations. The Standard Cost took account of the costs\
  \ of labour, plants, machinery, materials and supervision to do work to the specification\
  \ as set out in the SFGS Standard Costs and Specifications Booklet.    Depending\
  \ upon the level of public benefit, grant payments were either at 60% or 90% of\
  \ the Standard Cost. In the case of restocking, Standard Costs were mostly pitched\
  \ at 75% of the new planting Standard Costs.    Grants were available for planting\
  \ proposals that met one or more of the following objectives:    Establishing well-designed\
  \ productive woodland.Expanding areas of native woodland, preferably through natural\
  \ regeneration and the development of Forest Habitat Networks.Improving riparian\
  \ habitat.Improving the quality and setting of urban or post-industrial areas.Improving\
  \ the diversity of the farmed and crofting landscape.    Details of all eligible\
  \ operations are set out within the 'Applicants Booklet' available from Conservancy\
  \ Offices.    SFGS OBJECTIVES  The abbreviations below list the SFGS objectives\
