notes: "<p>The Scottish Forestry Grant Scheme (SFGS) - encouraged the creation and\
  \ management of woods and forests to provide economic, environmental and social\
  \ benefits.\_ This dataset identifies deer fences from SFGS.  Following publication\
  \ of the Scottish Executive\u2019s Scottish Forestry Strategy 'Forests for Scotland'\
  \ the opportunity was taken to review the Woodland Grant Scheme and the Farm Woodland\
  \ Premium Scheme and give them a greater Scottish focus.     The Scottish Forestry\
  \ Grant Scheme (SFGS) - encouraged the creation and management of woods and forests\
  \ to provide economic, environmental and social benefits.    Grants were available\
  \ under three main areas:    Grants for woodland expansion - creating new woodlands.\
  \ Restocking grants, for replanting following felling. Stewardship grants, for a\
  \ range of activities in existing woodlands.    Applications for SFGS grants started\
  \ in June 2003 and closed in August 2006.     Most grants for SFGS were based on\
  \ a percentage of Standard Costs of agreed operations. The Standard Cost took account\
  \ of the costs of labour, plants, machinery, materials and supervision to do work\
  \ to the specification as set out in the SFGS Standard Costs and Specifications\
  \ Booklet.    Depending upon the level of public benefit, grant payments were either\
  \ at 60% or 90% of the Standard Cost. In the case of restocking, Standard Costs\
  \ were mostly pitched at 75% of the new planting Standard Costs.    Grants were\
  \ available for planting proposals that met one or more of the following objectives:\
  \    Establishing well-designed productive woodland. Expanding areas of native woodland,\
  \ preferably through natural regeneration and the development of Forest Habitat\
  \ Networks. Improving riparian habitat. Improving the quality and setting of urban\
  \ or post-industrial areas. Improving the diversity of the farmed and crofting landscape.\
  \    Details of all eligible operations are set out within the 'Applicants Booklet'\
  \ available from Conservancy Offices.    SFGS OBJECTIVES  The abbreviations below\
  \ list the SFGS objectives proposals are designed to meet:    Establishment grants\
  \     P1 to establish well-designed productive forest P2 to expand the area of native\
  \ woodland P3 to improve a riparian habitat P4 to improve the quality and setting\
  \ of urban or post-industrial areas P5 to improve the diversity of the farmed/crofting\
  \ landscape    Stewardship Grants     S1 to improve timber quality S2 to reduce\
  \ deer numbers S3 to improve the ecological value of native woodlands S4 to improve\
  \ woodland biodiversity S5 to enhance landscape value S6 to develop alternative\
  \ systems to clear-felling S7 to develop woodland recreation S8 to develop community\
