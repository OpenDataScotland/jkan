notes: '<p>The current UK Parliament constituencies were set in 2005.  The majority
  of the Aberdeen City area falls within 2 constituencies:</p>

  <ul>

  <li><strong>Aberdeen North</strong></li>

  <li><strong>Aberdeen South</strong></li>

  </ul>

  <p>Aberdeen City Council is responsible for organising general election ballots
  within these constituencies and is therefore able to share the election results
  (including votes cast per candidate and rejected ballots) as open data.  More information
  about elections and voting within Aberdeen is available on the <a href="https://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/services/council-and-democracy">Council
  and Democracy section of the <strong>Aberdeen City Council</strong> website</a>.</p>

  <p>A large part of the north of Aberdeen City, including Dyce and some parts of
  Bucksburn, falls within the <strong>Gordon</strong> constituency where general election
  ballots are administrated by Aberdeenshire Council.  Detailed results for Gordon,
  and the other constituencies administrated by Aberdeenshire Council can be found
  on the <a href="https://www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk/council-and-democracy/elections/">elections
  section of the Aberdeenshire Council website</a>.</p>

  <p>For more information on UK Parliamentary Constituencies see the <a href="https://www.bcomm-scotland.independent.gov.uk/">Boundary
  Commission for Scotland website</a>.   </p>

  <hr />

  <p>The <strong>Election Results - General Elections</strong> dataset contains 3
