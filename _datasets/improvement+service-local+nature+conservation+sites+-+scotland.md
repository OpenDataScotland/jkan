notes: <p>Local nature conservation sites (LNCS) is a non-statutory designation given
  by local authorities to areas of locally important nature and landscapes. NatureScot,
  on behalf of the Local Nature Conservation Sites Working Group, published guidance
  (https://www.nature.scot/professional-advice/protected-areas-and-species/protected-areas/local-designations/local-nature-conservation-sites)
  for local authorities on the establishment and management of LNCS systems in Scotland.   One
  of the LNCS working group's recommendations was that all local authorities should
  adopt the LNCS name in place of the many different local names. However, many councils
  still use alternative names for these sites such as Local Biodiversity Sites, Local
  Wildlife Sites, Local Geodiversity Sites and Sites of Interest for Nature Conservation.
  We have merged these all into this national dataset.  Several LAs are still to confirm
  and digitise their LNCSs.</p>
