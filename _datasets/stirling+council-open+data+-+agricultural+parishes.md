  <p>Agricultural parishes are based on Civil Parishes which were abolished as an
  administrative unit in Scotland in 1975. Agricultural parishes continue to be used
  for boundary and statistical purposes. Agricultural parish boundaries were last
  updated in 2016. There are 891 agricultural parishes in Scotland and they are used
  in the Agricultural Census and for the payment of farming grants and subsidies.
  The dataset contains parish boundaries, parish names, parish codes and GSS codes
  (the latter were assigned in September 2023 to allow for the publication of Official
  Statistics for this geography, although the original parish codes also remain in
  use).</p>'
