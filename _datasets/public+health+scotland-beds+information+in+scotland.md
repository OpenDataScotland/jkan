notes: <p>To provide an effective, safe and efficient service to patients, hospitals
  must balance the provision of staffed beds against anticipated demand. Historically,
  the total number of beds has been reducing in line with evolving models of healthcare
  provision which aim to reduce the frequency and duration of hospital admissions
  and improve the integration of health and social care services. This strategy aims
  to improve outcomes for patients and reduce the likelihood of future hospital admissions.\r\n</p>
