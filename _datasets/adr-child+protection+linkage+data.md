  authorities. Information is submitted for each investigation and case conference
  held, as well as demographic information for each child. If a member of the public
  or a professional report concern about a child, a referral will be made to an agency
  such as the local authority social work team. If it is decided that the child is
  at risk of significant harm, an investigation will be undertaken. Prepared by Administrative
