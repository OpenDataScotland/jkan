notes: '<p>These strategies are a requirement that has now been added into the Town
  and Country Planning (Scotland) Act.   http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2019/13/part/4/crossheading/forestry-and-woodland-strategy/enacted  Most
  councils already have a FWS and these are normally accompanied by spatial data.
  Some of the strategies are produced jointly across Councils, e.g. Stirling &amp;
  Clackmannanshire, Edinburgh &amp; Lothians, Glasgow Clyde Valley.  Generally, the
  FWS datasets contain similar attribution which identifies the FWS Classification,
  or the potential areas for woodland expansion.  The attribution is usually along
  the lines of: Preferred, Potential, Sensitive, Unsuitable.  Some of the councils
  have produced a few layers of data for their FWS which might apply specifically
  to woodland planting types, e.g. a separate FWS layer for native woodlands or for
  productive woodlands.  Please note the data has been created using data of different
  scales (regional/local) and has been created as a high level assessment tool. The
  data should be viewed NO larger than 1:25000. Identification as a preferred area
  does not imply automatic approval of woodland planting proposals. Applications will
  be assessed based on site conditions. To be used in conjunction with the published
  supplementary guidance.</p>'
