notes: "<div><b>This dataset is published as Open Data</b></div>\n<div><br /></div>\n\
  <div>Every local authority and National Park authority (access authorities) in Scotland\
  \ is required to draw up a plan for a system of paths (core paths) sufficient for\
  \ the purpose of giving the public reasonable access throughout their area.</div>\n\
  <div><br /></div>\n<div>Core paths are paths, waterways or any other means of crossing\
  \ land to facilitate, promote and manage the exercise of access rights under the\
  \ Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003, and are identified as such in access authority\
  \ core paths plan.</div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>There are, intentionally, no set\
  \ physical standards for core paths. This means that core paths can physically be\
  \ anything from a faint line across a field to a fully constructed path, track or\
  \ pavement. The National Access Forum, Scottish Natural Heritage and Scottish Government\
  \ are encouraging information to be surveyed and made publicly available, in a nationally-standardised\
  \ form, so that the public will know what physical type of route they can expect.\_\
  </div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>Government guidance is making core paths the priority\
  \ for rolling out this national standardised grading system information, which is\
  \ set out at https://www.pathsforall.org.uk/resources/resource/the-path-managers-guide-to-grading</div>"
