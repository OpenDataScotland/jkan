notes: <p>Many Local Authorities capture locational details of certain safety features
  located across their area of jurisdiction. This dataset attempts to pull those features
  together into one single national dataset.  It currently contains defibrillator,
  water access points, fire hydrant, lifebelt and CCTV locations where local authorities
  have provided them.  It is likely that this dataset will be superseded and/ or conflated
  into a national emergency services gazetteer as and when that is created.</p>
