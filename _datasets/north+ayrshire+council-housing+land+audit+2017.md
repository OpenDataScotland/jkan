notes: <p>Scottish Planning Policy ( SPP) requires that a five-year ongoing effective
  land supply is available to meet the identified housing land requirements. Planning
  authorities should therefore carry out regular monitoring of housing completions
  and the progress of sites through the planning process. This can be achieved through
  the preparation of a housing land audit, carried out annually by the planning authority
  in conjunction with housing and infrastructure providers.</p>
