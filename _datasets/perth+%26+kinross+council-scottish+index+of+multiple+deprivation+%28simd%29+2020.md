notes: "<div>The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation is a relative measure of deprivation\
  \ across small areas (called data zones). If an area is identified as \u2018deprived\u2019\
  , this can relate to people having a low income but it can also mean fewer resources\
  \ or opportunities. SIMD looks at the extent to which an area is deprived across\
  \ seven domains: income, employment, education, health, access to services, crime\
  \ and housing.<br /></div>"
