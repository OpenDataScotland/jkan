notes: "<p>This new planning applications data has been created using a custom built\
  \ 'Cloud Connector Framework' which enables the automated collection of data from\
  \ local data systems on a weekly basis. Some planning authorities data may be missing\
  \ until all have configured their own CCF connection.  There are 2 layers: Points\
  \ &amp; Polygons.  Currently missing data from Edinburgh (Polgons only), East Ayrshire\
  \ (Polygons only), East Lothian, Scottish Borders &amp; West Lothian   'Development\
  \ management' is the name given to the process of deciding planning applications\
  \ and various other associated activities including enforcement of planning controls.\
  \ For the purposes of planning applications, development in Scotland is put into\
  \ one of three categories \u2013 'local', 'major' or 'national'. The different categories\
  \ mean that applications are treated in a way which is suited to the size and complexity\
  \ of the proposed development and the issues they are likely to raise. Most applications\
  \ will be for 'local' developments. 'Major' developments include applications for\
  \ 50 or more homes, certain waste, water, transport and energy-related developments,\
  \ and larger retail developments. 'National' developments are specific projects\
  \ which have been identified in the National Planning Framework because of their\
  \ national importance. Scottish Ministers become involved in a small minority of\
  \ cases, but only do so where it involves a matter of genuine national interest.\
  \  We strongly recommend that, when using the WFS for this dataset, because of it's\
  \ size you should use it with a filter. For example with the attributes 'local_authority'\
  \ and 'year'.</p>"
