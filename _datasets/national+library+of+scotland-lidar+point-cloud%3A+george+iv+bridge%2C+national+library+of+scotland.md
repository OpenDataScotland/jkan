notes: "<p>This dataset is a product of two terrestrial-based remote-sensing scanning\
  \ surveys conducted at different interior and exterior sections of the National\
  \ Library of Scotland George IV Bridge, including the Reading Room, the Stack Floor\
  \ and the subterranean Vaults. Point-clouds are forensic-grade topographic datasets,\
  \ retrieved through a particular method of remote-sensing known as Light Detection\
  \ and Ranging (LiDAR). LiDAR scanning is instrumental recording of the world through\
  \ a bat-like chirp of time-stamped photons and laser pulses, and the computational\
  \ analysis of the returning echoes, using a ground-based scanning instrument. Each\
  \ echo in a point cloud is categorised in a local Cartesian Coordinates system,\
  \ appended with RBG colour model and thermal data. The aim of the scanning survey\
  \ was to digitise different architectural spaces and reveal spatial and morphological\
  \ instances of the National Library of Scotland, otherwise occluded to human perception.\
  \ The point-cloud datasets offer a unique locus to quarantine and record entropies\
  \ of the built-environment\_with sub-millimetre accuracy into a three-dimensional\
  \ model \u2013 which can be probed in silico. The world suspended in a point-cloud\
  \ when visualised appears as a translucent swarm of data dust \u2013 therefore,\
  \ it also serves a visuospatial paradigm to speculate and anticipate, diagram and\
  \ animate alternative futures and counterfactual histories of our cultural heritage.\

  \ Edinburgh . Visit Dr Asad Khan\u2019s website: The Entropy Project The project\
  \ was funded by the National Library of Scotland and Edinburgh Futures Institute\
  \ , with support from the Centre for Data, Culture and Society and the uCreate Studio\
