notes: '<p>Land is legally defined as ''contaminated'' where substances are causing
  or could cause significant harm to people, property or protected species as well
  as causing significant pollution to surface waters (for example lakes and rivers)
  or groundwater.</p>

  <p>Land can become contaminated by a variety of substances, from heavy metals to
  agricultural waste. The environmental, financial and legal implications of this
  can be substantial.</p>

  <p>The management and remediation of contaminated land that, in its current state,
  is causing or has the potential to cause significant harm or significant pollution
  of the water environment, is regulated by legislation and underpinned by the core
  principles of the ''polluter pays'' and a ''suitable for use approach''.</p>

  <p>Local authorities are the primary regulator for the contaminated land regime
  (SEPA also has certain responsibilities within the scope of the legislation) to
  regulate activities and assist in the management and remediation of contaminated
  land.</p>

  <p>The current regulation regarding Contaminated Land is contained within the Environmental
  Protection Act (1990) known as Part IIA. Part IIA is further established in Scotland
  by the Contaminated Land (Scotland) Regulations 2000 (SSI 2000/178), as amended
  and the Scottish Government''s Statutory Guidance: Edition 2 provides the detailed
  framework for the definition, identification and remediation of contaminated land.</p>

  <p>THIS SPATIAL DATASET IS ONLY CONFIRMED CONTAMINATED LAND AND DOES NOT INCLUDE
  POTENTIALLY CONTAMINATED LAND</p>

  <p>Site name, date designated, website URL (for further information), status (confirmed
  or remediated) and remediation dates (where applicable) are all now mandatory attributes
  for this dataset.</p>'
