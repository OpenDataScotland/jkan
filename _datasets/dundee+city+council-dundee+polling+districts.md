notes: <div><span style="color:rgb(51,51,51);font-family:Montserrat, sans-serif;font-size:14px;">The
  Representation of the People Act 1983 places a duty on LA to divide the local authority
  area into polling districts based on ward boundaries, and to designate a polling
  place for each district. LAs also have a duty to keep these polling arrangements
  under review. The Electoral Administration Act 2006 introduced amendments to the
  1983 Act (which in turn has been superseded by The Electoral Administration Act
  2013). Now local authorities must conduct a full review (with public consultation)
  of its polling districts and polling places every four years, however adjustments
  to the boundaries of polling districts and the designation of polling places within
  LA wards can be proposed at any time in response to changes in ward boundaries or
  to the availability of premises that can be reasonably designated as polling places.</span></div>
