notes: "<p>James McBey (1883-1959) was a self-taught <strong>printmaker</strong>,\
  \ <strong>draughtsman</strong> and <strong>painter</strong> of international repute,\
  \ whose life revolved around art and adventure. Born in <strong>Foveran</strong>\
  \ in Aberdeenshire, he worked as a clerk for the North of Scotland Bank. In his\
  \ spare time, he taught himself etching from a book borrowed from Aberdeen Public\
  \ Library, producing his first printed works using his grandparents\u2019 mangle.\
  \ </p>\n<p>Marguerite McBey nee Loeb (1905-1999) met James McBey in America, where\
  \ she was a practicing photographer and bookbinder. They married in 1931 and lived\
  \ in America and Morocco. Marguerite amassed a <strong>substantial archive of books,\
  \ letters and diaries</strong> charting her life with her husband. After his death\
  \ in 1959 she donated this archive, along with numerous examples of his work, to\
  \ Aberdeen Art Gallery, making the city\u2019s McBey collection the best in the\
  \ world.  </p>\n<p>This open dataset includes all the items in the Aberdeen Art\
  \ Gallery McBey collection.  We are releasing it as open data to increase public\
