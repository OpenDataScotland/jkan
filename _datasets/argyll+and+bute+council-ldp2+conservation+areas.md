notes: <p>Conservation Areas designated in the Argyll and Bute Local Development Plan
  2. Conservation Areas "are areas of special architectural or historic interest,
  the character or appearance of which it is desirable to preserve or enhance". S.61
  Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) (Scotland) Act 1997 Conservation
  Areas are crucial to the conservation of our environment. They can cover historic
  land, battlefields, public parks, designed landscapes or railways but most contain
  groups of buildings extending over areas of a village, town or city. To safeguard
  them for the enjoyment and benefit of future generations any new development should
  preserve or enhance their varied character.</p>
