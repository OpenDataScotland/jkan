notes: "<p>George Washington Wilson (1823-1893), born in <strong>Alvah</strong>, Aberdeenshire,\
  \ was a pioneering Scottish photographer. By the early 1850s he was established\
  \ in <strong>Aberdeen</strong> as an <strong>artist and portrait photographer</strong>.\
  \ He received a contract to photograph the Royal Family, working for Queen Victoria\
  \ and Prince Albert and was later commissioned to <strong>illustrate Queen Victoria\u2019\
  s diaries</strong> of her time in Scotland when they were published. By the 1860s\
  \ he was increasingly focussed on landscapes and stereoscopic views.   </p>\n<p>This\
  \ dataset is a list of all the items relating to <strong>George Washington Wilson</strong>,\
  \ his company and successor companies, held by Aberdeen Art Gallery &amp; Museums.\
  \ We are releasing it as open data to increase public awareness of, and access to,\
  \ the collection. We hope it may prove useful in identifying which photographic\
  \ images are unique across public collections in the UK but we're also keen to hear\
  \ of any novel uses this data is used for.   </p>\n<p>For further information or\
