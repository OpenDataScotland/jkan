notes: "<div>The project is funded by Transport Scotland and is a joint survey between\
  \ Sustrans and all 32 Scottish local authorities.</div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>Each\
  \ September, schools across Scotland complete the survey by asking their pupils\
  \ \u2018How do you normally travel to school?\u2019. Council staff distribute the\
  \ survey to schools and return pupil responses to the Sustrans\u2019 Research and\
  \ Monitoring Unit for overall collation, analysis and reporting.</div>\n<div><br\
  \ /></div>\n<div>The most recent results, published on 24th June 2021 in the 2020\
