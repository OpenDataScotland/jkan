notes: <p>Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare Associated Infection (ARHAI) Scotland,
  part of National Services Scotland works closely with Public Health Scotland to
  deliver the COVID-19 response. This dataset provides data for hospital onset COVID-19
  cases in Scotland for week ending 1 March 2020 to week ending 5 February 2023.\r\n\r\nCOVID-19
  cases first diagnosed within hospital inpatients are classed as hospital onset COVID-19,
  with the length of time between admission and the date of first positive test of
  new infections or reinfection episodes (90 days from previous COVID-19 positive
  result), determining their hospital onset status. This dataset includes all probable
  and definite hospital onset COVID-19 cases. Data are published on the Open Data
  platform at NHS Scotland level, by week of specimen date.\r\n\r\nAll publications
  and supporting material to this topic area can be found in the weekly Hospital onset
  COVID-19 cases in Scotland publication. Further information on SARS-CoV-2 and current
  infection prevention and control (IPC) guidance can be found in the National Infection
  Prevention and Control Manual. \r\n\r\nDue to the lower number of hospital onset
  COVID-19 cases, and to support NHS boards by reducing local Infection Prevention
  and Control Team resource required for surveillance, the last publication of this
  data was on 1 March 2023.\r\n</p>
