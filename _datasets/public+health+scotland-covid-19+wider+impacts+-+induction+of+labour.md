notes: <p>Care for women around the time they are giving birth is an essential, time
  critical service that cannot be deferred. As such, it has been provided throughout
  the COVID-19 pandemic, and maternity staff have not been redeployed to support other
  services. The way that some elements of this care are provided has changed in response
  to COVID-19 however, to minimise the risk of infection and to allow services to
  continue to provide safe care during times when a high number of staff may be off
  work, for example due to needing to isolate.\r\n\r\nGuidance issued by the Scottish
  Government and Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists to maternity services
  at the height of the first wave of the pandemic noted that:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tIt may
  be necessary for services to temporarily suspend the option for women to deliver
  at home or in midwife led units, and to concentrate delivery care within obstetric
  units\r\n\r\n\u2022\tAdditional restrictions on the use of water births were recommended\r\n\r\n\u2022\tCare
  pathways for women requiring induction of labour should be amended to ensure the
  early stages of the induction process were delivered on an outpatient basis wherever
  possible\r\n\r\n\u2022\tServices should consider deferring a planned induction of
  labour or elective caesarean section if a woman was isolating due to having COVID-19,
  or having been in contact with a case, if it was safe to do so\r\n\r\n\u2022\tServices
  should support low risk women in the early latent phase of labour to remain at home
  wherever possible\r\n\r\n\u2022\tIn general, strict restrictions on visitors for
  patients in hospital were advised, however women giving birth could still be accompanied
  by their chosen birth partner\r\n\r\n'Induction of labour' is when a woman is given
  a medical intervention to start her labour rather than waiting for labour to start
  spontaneously. It is offered because there are medical reasons meaning it is considered
  safer (for the mother or baby) for the baby to be born, or because a woman is past
  her \u2018due date\u2019. There are different approaches to inducing labour, for
  example using medicines, a medical \u2018balloon\u2019 device that sits at the neck
  of the womb, and/or breaking the woman\u2019s waters.\r\n\r\nThis dataset shows
  information on induction of labour, presented at Scotland and NHS Board level. Scotland
  level data is also available by age group and deprivation category. The information
  on induction of labour presented in this dataset is taken from hospital discharge
  records, specifically records relating to the care of women delivering a singleton
  live birth (i.e. one baby, not twins or more) at 37-42 weeks gestation (i.e. up
  to 3 weeks before or after their due date).\r\n\r\nThis data is also available on
