notes: <p>Town centres and other retail centres are defined by local authorities to
  meet the requirement of Scottish Planning Policy (paragraph 61) to identify town
  centres and other retail locations as part of a network of centres to support retail
  type development in the most appropriate locations. This network of centres forms
  part of the sequential test in assessing retail planning applications, which should
  be located firstly in town centres, then in other retail centres or edge-of-centre
  sites, so the dataset provides key locational information in assisting retail planning
  and policies. These centres may be defined in local development plans in the first
  instance.</p>
