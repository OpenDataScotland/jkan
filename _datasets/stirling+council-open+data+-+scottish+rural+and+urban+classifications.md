  <p>The Scottish Government (SG) Urban Rural Classification provides a consistent
  way of defining urban and rural areas across Scotland. The classification aids policy
  development and the understanding of issues facing urban, rural and remote communities.
  It is based upon two main criteria: (i) population as defined by National Records
  of Scotland (NRS), and (ii) accessibility based on drive time analysis to differentiate
  between accessible and remote areas in Scotland. The classification can be analysed
  in a two, three, six or eight fold form. The two-fold classification simply distinguishes
  between urban and rural areas through two categories, urban and rural, while the
  three-fold classification splits the rural category between accessible and remote.
  Most commonly used is the 6-fold classification which distinguishes between urban,
  rural, and remote areas through six categories. The 8-fold classification further
  distinguishes between remote and very remote regions. The Classification is normally
  updated on a biennial basis, with the current dataset reflective of the year 2020.
  Data for previous versions are available for download in ESRI Shapefile format.</p>'
