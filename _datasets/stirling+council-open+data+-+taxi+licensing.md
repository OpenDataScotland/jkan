notes: <div>Throughout Scotland, high quality taxi and private hire car services play
  an essential part in local transport networks, providing an invaluable service for
  both residents and visitors to Scotland. Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982, the
  aim of any licensing regime is the preservation of public safety and order and the
  prevention of crime. Local authorities are responsible for the creation, management
  and enforcement of the local taxi and private hire car licensing regime following
  the framework provided for in the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982.</div>
