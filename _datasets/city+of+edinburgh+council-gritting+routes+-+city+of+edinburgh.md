notes: '<p>Each local authority creates gritting routes and regimes to keep their
  most important roads (and in some cases footpaths) and networks clear come bad winter
  weather. Most LAs create this as a line dataset. So the national dataset is a line
  format dataset. Some LAs collect this data as a polygon dataset. We are working
  with them to convert this into line formats in the future.</p>

  <p>We have removed trunk roads that are cleared by private companies e.g BEAR and
  AMEY from this dataset for the time being as they aren''t currently under the LA
  gritting route regime.</p>

  <p>Eventually, the Street Gazetteer will enable us to identify these routes more
  accurately and coherently.</p>'
