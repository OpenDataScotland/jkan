notes: '<p>An Article 4 Direction is a statement made under The Town and Country Planning
  (General Permitted Development) (Scotland) Amendment Order 2011. The Direction,
  made by a local authority and approved by Scottish Ministers, removes all or some
  of the permitted development rights on an area.  The effect of a Direction is that
  planning permission will be required for specific types of development which would
  otherwise be regarded as ''permitted development'', i.e. development that does not
  require a planning application. Directions can cover a variety of minor works and
  might include: the replacement of doors and windows, the erection of gates, fences,
  garages, sheds, porches, storage tanks or the installation of satellite antennae.  Article
  4 Directions complement Conservation Areas and may overlap these. This dataset should
  be used alongside Conservation Areas when considering built environment heritage
  constraints on development.</p>'
