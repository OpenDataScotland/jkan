notes: <p><span style='color:rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family:Montserrat, sans-serif;
  font-size:14px;'>Local government in Scotland comprises 32 unitary local authorities,
  which are responsible for the provision of a range of public services such as education,
  licensing regulations, social care, transport and waste management. The current
  authority boundaries are largely a result of reorganization that took place in 1996,
  following the enactment of the Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994 which abolished
  the two tier structure of regions and districts. The Local Government Boundary Commission
  for Scotland is responsible for recommendations on the definition of local authority
  boundaries, however, the definitive dataset is delineated by Ordnance Survey for
  inclusion in their BoundaryLine product.</span></p>
