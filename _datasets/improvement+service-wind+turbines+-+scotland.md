notes: <p>This point dataset represents every known (and/ or applied for) wind turbine
  over 15m (to turbine tip) in the country. It includes details (where known) of planning
  reference, height, status (i.e. approved, developed, withdrawn), number of turbines
  on the site etc.  Some local authority areas (e.g. more southern) are more up-to-date
  than others (in the north). However, we will endeavour to get this dataset more
  complete in the coming months.</p>
