notes: "<p>Trial the data: This official annual reference book was first published\
  \ in the 1946 by the British Information Service. Primarily for the overseas reader\
  \ it was designed to answer questions about Britain which were most frequently asked\
  \ in overseas countries by writers, teachers, their officials and administrators\
  \ and their economists. In 1954, produced by the Central Statistical Office, it\
  \ was distributed overseas in a limited free edition and was on sale through Her\
  \ Majesty\u2019s Stationery Office worldwide. The National Library of Scotland collection\
  \ covers the years 1954-2005. These volumes draw on a wide range of authoritative\
  \ sources and provide a factual overview of the United Kingdom, whilst also covering\
  \ the main aspects of government policy and the part played by Government in the\
  \ life of the community. They do not, however, attempt to describe the part played\
  \ by Britain in the Commonwealth or world affairs. Topics are consistent throughout\
  \ the volumes and cover: the national economy; social welfare; defence; religion,\
  \ science and the arts; broadcasting and the press, transport and communication;\
  \ trade and industry.\_The volumes also include maps showing, for example, the major\
  \ road and rail networks, conservation areas and population density. While the contents\
  \ refer to the UK as a whole, where separate facts and figures were available for\
  \ England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland these have also been included.</p>"
