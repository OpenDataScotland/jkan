notes: '<p><strong>For each year since 2014, datasets under this heading, sourced
  from <a href="https://www.scotpho.org.uk/">Public Health Information for Scotland
  (ScotPHO)</a>, show, for all Intermediate Zones within the Stirling Council area,
  the estimated life expectancy at birth for females and males expressed as a five-year
  average.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Defined by the </strong><a href="https://www.scotlandscensus.gov.uk/variables-classification/sns-data-zone-2011#:~:text=The%20data%20zone%20geography%20covers,around%20500%20to%201%2C000%20residents."><strong>Scottish
  Neighbourhood Statistics (SNS) Data Zone 2011</strong></a><strong> geography, Intermediate
  Zones are similar to Data Zones. The key difference is their size: Intermediate
  Zones have a population of around 4,000 and are built from Data Zones. Intermediate
  Zones are often used when the data are not suitable for release at Data Zone level
  due to the sensitive nature of their content. The larger populations of Intermediate
  Zones, therefore, mean that data published are likely to require less rigorous disclosure
  control.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Of the 6,976 Data Zones in Scotland, each covering
  a population of between 500 and 1000 residents, there are 121 within the Stirling
  Council area, accounting for 24 Intermediate Zones.</strong>\r\n</p>'
