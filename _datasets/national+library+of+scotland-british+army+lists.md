notes: "<p>Trial the data: The official Army Lists give details of officers serving\
  \ in the British Army. There is also an unofficial alternative to these, which is\
  \ \u2018Hart\u2019s Army list,\u2019 initially created by Lieutenant-General George\
  \ Hart, which lists officers in both the British and Indian Army. The lists are\
  \ a useful resource for tracing an officer\u2019s war service as they give details\
  \ of promotions and appointments as well as gallantry medals and regiment locations.\
  \ Colonial, militia and territorial units, the yeomanry cavalry, the Indian Civil\
  \ Service, medical and veterinary officers and even retired officers on pay and\
  \ pension are also listed. This dataset covers Hart\u2019s Army lists from 1839-1915\
  \ and the Official Army lists 1879-1950. These lists were issued monthly, quarterly\
  \ and half yearly. Related datasets Visit the British Navy Lists page on the Data\
