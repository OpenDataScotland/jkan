  Boards, established by Local Authorities, manage alcohol and public entertainment
  licenses, make decisions on applications, review appeals, and set local policies.
  Civic Licenses for activities like street trading and late-night refreshment are
  also administered to ensure standards and regulations are met, safeguarding public
  welfare. Additionally, Local Authorities regulate taxi services, ensuring driver
  competence and vehicle safety. This comprehensive oversight maintains public safety
  and upholds standards across licensed activities in Scotland.<br /></div></p>
