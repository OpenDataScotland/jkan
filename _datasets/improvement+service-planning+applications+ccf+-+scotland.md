notes: "<p>'Development management' is the name given to the process of deciding planning\
  \ applications and various other associated activities including enforcement of\
  \ planning controls. For the purposes of planning applications, development in Scotland\
  \ is put into one of three categories \u2013 'local', 'major' or 'national'. The\
  \ different categories mean that applications are treated in a way which is suited\
  \ to the size and complexity of the proposed development and the issues they are\
  \ likely to raise. Most applications will be for 'local' developments. 'Major' developments\
  \ include applications for 50 or more homes, certain waste, water, transport and\
  \ energy-related developments, and larger retail developments. 'National' developments\
  \ are specific projects which have been identified in the National Planning Framework\
  \ because of their national importance. Scottish Ministers become involved in a\
  \ small minority of cases, but only do so where it involves a matter of genuine\
  \ national interest.</p>\n<p>We strongly recommend that, when using the WFS for\
  \ this dataset, because of it's size you should use it with a filter.   For example\
  \ with the attributes 'local_authority' and 'year'.</p>"
