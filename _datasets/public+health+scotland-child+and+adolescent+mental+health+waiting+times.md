notes: '<p>The main function of CAMHS is to develop and deliver services for those
  children and young people (and their parents/carers) who are experiencing the most
  serious mental health problems. They also have an important role in supporting the
  mental health capability of the wider network of children''s services. CAMHS are
  usually delivered by multidisciplinary teams including nurses, psychiatrists, psychologists,
  social workers, and others.\r\n\r\nDelivery of good quality CAMHS depends on adequate
  numbers of well trained staff being recruited and retained across NHSScotland. Practitioners
  who contribute to CAMHS include: psychiatric nurses, child and adolescent psychiatrists,
  clinical psychologists, social workers, psychotherapists (including child/analytical,
  systemic/family, cognitive behavioural), creative therapists (including art, music
  and drama), play therapists, liaison teachers, speech and language therapists, occupational
  therapists and dieticians.\r\n\r\nTimely access to healthcare is a key measure of
  quality and that applies equally in respect of access to mental health services.
  Early action is more likely to result in full recovery and, in the case of children
  and young people, will also minimise the impact on other aspects of their development
  such as their education, so improving their wider social development outcomes.\r\n\r\nCAMHS
  are subject to deliver an 18 week wait from referral to treatment for specialist
  services this has been the standard since December 2014. This supersedes the previous
  target of 26 weeks. The data shows the performances of the board in relation to
  this standard.</p>'
