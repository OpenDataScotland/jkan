notes: <p>Vacant land is previously developed land that is available for redevelopment.
  Derelict land is previously developed land which has a physical constraint caused
  by its previous use that hampers its redevelopment or naturalization.  Reducing
  the amount of vacant and derelict land is a priority for Fife and is part of the
  Single Outcome Agreement between Fife Council and the Scottish Government. We carry
  out an annual survey of vacant &amp; derelict land in Fife.</p>
