notes: '<p>Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) splits Scotland into data
  zones which are given ranking from most deprived to least deprived.\r\n\r\nThis
  data set contains population weighted quintiles and deciles for health board, council
  area, and health and social care partnership where appropriate. Also available is
  an indicator as to whether a data zone is in the 15% most deprived or 15% least
  deprived data zones in Scotland.\r\n\r\nSIMD is based on a number of indicators:\r\n\r\n<em>
  Access to Services\r\n\r\n</em> Crime\r\n\r\n<em> Education\r\n\r\n</em> Employment\r\n\r\n<em>
  Health\r\n\r\n</em> Housing\r\n\r\n* Income\r\n\r\nNote: An area may be classed
  as deprived but residents may not be deprived, and an area may be classed as not
  deprived but this doesn''t mean residents are not deprived. SIMD is not a tool for
  saying <strong>how much more</strong> deprived one area is from another.</p>'
