notes: '<p>Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) splits Scotland into data
  zones which are given ranking from most deprived to least deprived.</p>

  <p>This data set contains population weighted quintiles and deciles for health board,
  council area, and health and social care partnership where appropriate. Also available
  is an indicator as to whether a data zone is in the 15% most deprived or 15% least
  deprived data zones in Scotland.</p>

  <p>SIMD is based on a number of indicators:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>

  <p>Access to Services</p>

  </li>

  <li>

  <p>Crime</p>

  </li>

  <li>

  <p>Education</p>

  </li>

  <li>

  <p>Employment</p>

  </li>

  <li>

  <p>Health</p>

  </li>

  <li>

  <p>Housing</p>

  </li>

  <li>

  <p>Income</p>

  </li>

  </ul>

  <p>Note: An area may be classed as deprived but residents may not be deprived, and
  an area may be classed as not deprived but this doesn''t mean residents are not
  deprived. SIMD is not a tool for saying <strong>how much more</strong> deprived
  one area is from another.</p>'
