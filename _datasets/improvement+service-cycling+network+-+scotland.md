notes: "<p>Many local authorities capture details of the cycle network within their\
  \ jurisdiction. These may be lanes along roads or segregated paths away from vehicles.\
  \ This dataset attempts to pull anything that local authorities can provide to us\
  \ together into a national network. It may be missing details held by other national\
  \ organisations.  We have now also added the Scottish part of SUSTRANS' National\
  \ Cycle Network dataset (which will now be available via an OGC web service for\
  \ the first time).   Sustrans National Cycle Network data contains Ordnance Survey\
  \ data (\xA9 Crown copyright and database rights (2018)).</p>"
