notes: <p>Many local authorities capture details of the cycle network within their
  jurisdiction. These may be lanes along roads or segregated paths away from vehicles.
  This dataset attempts to pull anything that local authorities can provide to us
  together into a national network. It may be missing details held by other national
  organisations.</p>
