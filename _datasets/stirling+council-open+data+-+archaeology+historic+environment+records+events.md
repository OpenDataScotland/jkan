  <div>HERs (Historic Environment Records) developed out of SMRs (Sites and Monuments
  Records). SMRs were established from the 1960s onwards in response to the loss of
  the archaeological resource through urban and rural development. From their original
  remit of recording archaeological sites, they have been developed to encompass a
  wide range of information about the historic environment which has been reflected
  in the change of name from SMR to HER. Today they provide a unique information resource,
  forming the basis for sustainable conservation and playing an important role in
  informing public understanding and enjoyment of the local historic environment.
  The historic environment includes all aspects of our surroundings that have been
  built, formed or influenced by human activities from earliest to most recent times.
  A Historic Environment Record stores and provides access to systematically organised
  information about these surroundings in a given area. It is maintained and updated
  for public benefit in accordance with national and international standards and guidance.
  An HER makes information accessible to all in order to: - advance knowledge and
  understanding of the historic environment; - inform its care and conservation; -
  inform public policies and decision-making on land-use planning and management;
  - contribute to environmental improvement and economic regeneration; - contribute
  to education and social inclusion; - encourage participation in the exploration,
  appreciation and enjoyment of the historic environment.</div>

  <div><br /></div>

  <div>Local authorities and most National Park authorities maintain records of the
  archaeological, built and natural environment. However, many services group together
  to form archaeological services to collate their standardised records. Specialist
  staff are employed to curate these records and also to provide specialist advice
  for land-use planning and public information services.</div>

  <div>This dataset has two distinct data layers: - Historic Environment Sites (including
  Known Site Extents and Areas of Archaeological Interest) - Historic Environment
  Events (also known as interventions)</div>'
