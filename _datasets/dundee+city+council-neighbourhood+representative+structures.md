notes: <p>Neighbourhood Representative Structures are supported and recognised by
  Dundee City Council in a similar way to Community Councils, and both have a right
  to consultation on matters relating to their neighbourhood. This dataset shows the
  active neighbourhood representation that the Council consults with across the City.\r\n\r\nFor
  Community Council boundaries only see the related Community Council Wards dataset.
  \r\n\r\nBackground on the formation and recognition of Neighbourhood Representative
  Structures is available in the Neighbourhood Resource and Development Committee
  report number 752-2002.</p>
