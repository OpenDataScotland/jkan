notes: "<p>This is a non-spatial table.  It contains data on Scottish Forestry Grant\
  \ Scheme (SFGS) operations that can be related to the SFGS Scheme Boundary spatial\
  \ dataset on the SCHEME_NO field (Scheme Number).\_ The spatial dataset is related\
  \ to this non-spatial table on a 'one to many' basis.\_ This reflects the fact that\
  \ many operations may occur within one SFGS Scheme Boundary.  This dataset was extracted\
  \ from the Grants and Licences System (GLS) that was used by the Forestry Commission\
  \ to manage grants for SFGS.\_ More details on SFGS and the associated spatial data\
  \ can be found in the metadata for the relevant spatial datasets.  SFGS encouraged\
  \ the creation and management of woods and forests to provide economic, environmental\
  \ and social benefits.  For more detailed information please see the metadata record\
  \ on Scotland's SpatialData.gov.scot Metadata Portal.</p>"
