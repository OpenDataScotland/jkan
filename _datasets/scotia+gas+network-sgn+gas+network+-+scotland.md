notes: "<p>SGN create 4 separate data layers (by pressure tier) to depict the location\
  \ of their gas network: LP           - Low Pressure (19 mbar - 75 mbar) MP     \
  \    - Medium Pressure (75mbar - 2 bar) IP            - Intermediate Pressure (2\
  \ bar - 7 bar) HP          - Regional High Pressure (&gt;7 bar)  The gas network\
  \ data is up to date at the time of publication, but it is given without warranty\
  \ as to the accuracy of the information shown.  Service pipes, valves, siphons,\
  \ sub-connections etc. are not shown but their presence should be anticipated. \
