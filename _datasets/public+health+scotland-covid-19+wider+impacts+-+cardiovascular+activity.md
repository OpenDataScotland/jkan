notes: <p>Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new strain of coronavirus first identified
  in Wuhan, China. Clinical presentation may range from mild-to-moderate illness to
  pneumonia or severe acute respiratory infection.\r\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has wider
  impacts on individuals\u2019 health, and their use of healthcare services, than
  those that occur as the direct result of infection. Reasons for this may include:\r\n\r\n\u2022
  Individuals being reluctant to use health services because they do not want to burden
  the NHS or are anxious about the risk of infection.\r\n\r\n\u2022 The health service
  delaying preventative and non-urgent care such as some screening services and planned
  surgery.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Other indirect effects of interventions to control COVID-19,
  such as mental or physical consequences of distancing measures.\r\n \r\nThis dataset
  provides information on trend data regarding the wider impact of the pandemic on
  cardiovascular attendances in A&amp;E departments. Data is available from the beginning
  of 2020 along with historical activity (average from 2018 and 2019) for comparison
  purposes. The recent trend data for Accident &amp; Emergency Department attendances
  are shown by age group, and by broad area deprivation category (Scottish Index of
  Multiple Deprivation, SIMD).\r\n\r\nThis data is also available on the <a href="https://scotland.shinyapps.io/phs-covid-wider-impact/">COVID-19
