notes: "<p>Land is legally defined as 'contaminated' where substances are causing\
  \ or could cause significant harm to people, property or protected species as well\
  \ as causing significant pollution to surface waters (for example lakes and rivers)\
  \ or groundwater.  Land can become contaminated by a variety of substances, from\
  \ heavy metals to agricultural waste. The environmental, financial and legal implications\
  \ of this can be substantial.  The management and remediation of contaminated land\
  \ that, in its current state, is causing or has the potential to cause significant\
  \ harm or significant pollution of the water environment, is regulated by legislation\
  \ and underpinned by the core principles of the 'polluter pays' and a 'suitable\
  \ for use approach'.  Local authorities are the primary regulator for the contaminated\
  \ land regime (SEPA also has certain responsibilities within the scope of the legislation)\
  \ to regulate activities and assist in the management and remediation of contaminated\
  \ land.  Contaminated Land can go through remediation work and this dataset attempts\
  \ to collect that detail. However, when a site has been remediated, it becomes suitable\
  \ for the current use (at the time of remediation), and that this doesn't mean the\
  \ site is 'clean' or has no contamination.  Further assessment/remediation may be\
  \ required should there be any change of use or new planning application etc.  The\
  \ current regulation regarding Contaminated Land is contained within the  Environmental\
  \ Protection Act (1990) known as Part IIA. Part IIA is further established in Scotland\
  \ by the Contaminated Land (Scotland) Regulations 2000 (SSI 2000/178), as amended\
  \ and the Scottish Government\u2019s Statutory Guidance: Edition 2 provides the\
  \ detailed framework for the definition, identification and remediation of contaminated\
  \ land.  THIS SPATIAL DATASET IS ONLY CONFIRMED (AND REMEDIATED) CONTAMINATED LAND\
  \ AND DOES NOT INCLUDE 'POTENTIALLY' CONTAMINATED LAND.</p>"
