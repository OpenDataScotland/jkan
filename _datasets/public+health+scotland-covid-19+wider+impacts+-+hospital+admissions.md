notes: <p>Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new strain of coronavirus first identified
  in Wuhan, China. Clinical presentation may range from mild-to-moderate illness to
  pneumonia or severe acute respiratory infection. \r\n\r\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has
  wider impacts on individuals\u2019 health, and their use of healthcare services,
  than those that occur as the direct result of infection.\r\nReasons for this may
  include:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Individuals being reluctant to use health services because
  they do not want to burden the NHS or are anxious about the risk of infection.\r\n\r\n\u2022
  The health service delaying preventative and non-urgent care such as some screening
  services and planned surgery.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Other indirect effects of interventions
  to control COVID-19, such as mental or physical consequences of distancing measures.\r\n\r\nThis
  dataset provides information on trend data regarding the wider impact of the pandemic
  on hospital admissions. Data are shown by age group, sex, broad deprivation category
  and specialty groups. Information is also available at different levels of geographical
  breakdown such as Health Boards, Health and Social Care partnerships, and Scotland
  totals. \r\n\r\nThis data is also available on the <a href="https://scotland.shinyapps.io/phs-covid-wider-impact/">COVID-19
