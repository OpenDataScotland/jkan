notes: "<p>Trial the data: This dataset consists of a complete run of \u2018The Spiritualist\u2019\
  , later \u2018The Spiritualist Newspaper\u2019, and a partial run of its short lived\
  \ successor \u2018Psyche\u2019. Published in London from 1869-1882, \u2018The Spiritualist\u2019\
  \ is a key title of the spiritualist movement, and significant in relation to the\
  \ development of the movement in the UK. Unusually for this era it has a strong\
  \ focus on women, due to their dominance in the movement. Spiritualism started in\
  \ New York in 1848 arriving in Britain in the 1850s. With no central structure or\
  \ key texts journals played an important role in the movement. Edinburgh-born Sir\
  \ Arthur Conan Doyle was among the supporters of spiritualism. Detractors included\
  \ his friend Harry Houdini, who collected spiritualist publications including this\
  \ title which is in the Harry Houdini Collection in the Library of Congress.</p>"
