notes: "<p>The Library\u2019s map collections incorporate huge quantities of data,\
  \ and we have a number of projects underway to extract this information. One project\
  \ we collaborated in has been the\_GB1900 gazetteer project. This crowdsourcing\
  \ project captured all the place names and written content from the\_Ordnance Survey\
  \ six-inch to the mile maps of England, Scotland and Wales\_from a century ago (1888-1913).\
  \ The resulting 2.5 million names is the largest ever historical gazetteer. The\
  \ GB1900 names can also be viewed, and queried as a gazetteer in our\_Explore Georeferenced\
  \ Maps viewer\_under the \u2018Search OS six-inch1888-1913 names\u2019. Demonstration\
  \ distribution maps of GB1900 features such as\_quarries/collieries,\_footpaths\_\
  and\_mills\_illustrate just a few of the potential opportunities with this gazetteer.\
