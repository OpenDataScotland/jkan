notes: "<p>In November 2004, Audit Scotland published a document entitled \u2018Maintaining\
  \ Scotland\u2019s Roads\u2019, effectively introducing a requirement on local authorities\
  \ in Scotland to produce a Roads Asset Management Plan (RAMP). Following this publication,\
  \ The Society of Chief Officers for Transportation in Scotland (SCOTS) produced\
  \ a common asset management framework through which all local authorities could\
  \ develop their own RAMP. Street assets/furniture are a key part of the RAMP and\
  \ as such a requirement exists for a national dataset of information. This can include\
  \ (although is not limited to) features such as bollards, road signs, barriers,\
  \ parking bays, bus shelters, cattle grids, gates, street lighting columns, benches/seats,\
  \ information boards, dog/litter/grit bins, cycle stands, ticket machines etc. etc.\
  \  We are currently only including furniture types that have been provided by more\
  \ than one council. These are: Benches Bollards Cattle Grids Cycle Parking Controllers\
  \ Dog Litter Bins Electric Vehicle Charging Points Grit Bins Litter Bins Memorials\
  \ Picnic Tables Street Lighting Columns Traffic Calming Traffic Signals Traffis\
  \ Signs Weather Stations  We understand that some local authorities are loading\
  \ this data into the VAULT system. We will work with the team managing that system\
  \ to ensure that there is one definitive list in the future.</p>"
