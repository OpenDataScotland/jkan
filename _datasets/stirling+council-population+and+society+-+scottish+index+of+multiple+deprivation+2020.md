  \ Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation 2020 is the Scottish Government\u2019s\
  \ official tool for identifying those places in Scotland suffering from deprivation.\
  \ It incorporates several different aspects of deprivation (employment, income,\
  \ health, education, skills and training, geographic access, crime and housing),\
  \ combining them into a single index.</span></font></div>\n<div><font color='#000000'\

  <div><font color='#000000' face='Open Sans, sans-serif'><span style='font-size:14px;'>The\
  \ 2020 Index provides a relative ranking for small areas in Scotland, defined by\
  \ the Scottish Neighbourhood Statistics (SNS) Data Zone 2011 geography, from 1 (most\
  \ deprived) to 6,976 (least deprived). By identifying small areas where there are\
  \ concentrations of multiple deprivation, the SIMD can be used to target policies\
  \ and resources at the places with greatest need. The SIMD also provides a rank\
  \ for each data zone within each of the seven domains, and therefore it is possible\
  \ to look at individual aspects of deprivation for each area, as well as the overall\
  \ level of deprivation.</span></font></div>\n<div><font color='#000000' face='Open\
