  provision points refer to specific locations or nodes where essential infrastructure
  services and facilities are made available to support community needs and development
  projects. These points are crucial in ensuring that the necessary infrastructure
  is strategically distributed and accessible within a given area. Here are some key
  aspects of infrastructure provision points:</div><div><ul><li>Utilities: These include
  water supply, sewage systems, electricity, gas, and telecommunications. Provision
  points for utilities ensure that all parts of a development have access to these
  essential services.</li><li>Transportation: Infrastructure provision points related
  to transportation might include bus stops, train stations, parking facilities, and
  intersections. These points are crucial for ensuring mobility and connectivity within
  the development.</li><li>Social Services: This includes schools, hospitals, community
  centers, and recreational facilities. Provision points for social services ensure
  that residents have access to education, healthcare, and social activities.</li><li>Green
  Spaces: Parks, gardens, and natural reserves are part of infrastructure provision
  points that contribute to the environmental sustainability and quality of life within
  the development.</li><li>Economic Infrastructure: This includes markets, commercial
  centers, and industrial zones. Provision points for economic infrastructure support
  the economic vitality of the community by providing spaces for business and employment
  opportunities.</li><li>Emergency Services: Locations for fire stations, police stations,
