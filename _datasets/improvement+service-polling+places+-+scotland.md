notes: "<p>A \u2018polling place\u2019 is defined as the building or area in which\
  \ a polling station will be located. A \u2018polling station\u2019 is the room or\
  \ area within the polling place where voting takes place. Unlike polling districts\
  \ and polling places which are fixed by the local authority, polling stations are\
  \ chosen by the (Acting) Returning Officer for the election.  The Representation\
  \ of the People Act 1983 places a duty on LA to divide the local authority area\
  \ into polling districts based on ward boundaries, and to designate a polling place\
  \ for each district. LAs also have a duty to keep these polling arrangements under\
  \ review. The Electoral Administration Act 2006 introduced amendments to the 1983\
  \ Act (which in turn has been superseded by The Electoral Administration Act 2013).\
  \ Now local authorities must conduct a full review (with public consultation) of\
  \ its polling districts and polling places every four years, however adjustments\
  \ to the boundaries of polling districts and the designation of polling places within\
  \ LA wards can be proposed at any time in response to changes in ward boundaries\
  \ or to the availability of premises that can be reasonably designated as polling\
  \ places.</p>"
