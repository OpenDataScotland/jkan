notes: "<p>Trial the data: This collection comprises twenty volumes of the most popular\
  \ descriptive gazetteers of Scotland in the 19th century. Principal places in Scotland,\
  \ including towns, counties, castles, glens, antiquities and parishes, are listed\
  \ alphabetically. Each entry includes detailed historical and geographical information\
  \ about each place. A gazetteer is usually described as a \u2018geographical index\
  \ or dictionary\u2019. They exist in various forms, and at their simplest, may be\
  \ just an alphabetical list of place-names together with locational information.\
  \ Descriptive gazetteers, in contrast, include lengthy descriptions about places,\
  \ often with details of their physical and human geography, as well as economic,\
  \ administrative and statistical data. As such, they form a written complement to\
  \ detailed maps and atlases, and some of these gazetteers were specifically intended\
  \ to complement cartographic works. Many of these descriptive gazetteers in Scotland\
  \ inherit elements from a longer tradition of topographic writing, such as the descriptive\
  \ chorographic texts in the Blaeu Atlas of Scotland (1654), the work of Sir Robert\
  \ Sibbald in the 17th century, and the Statistical Accounts of Scotland (1791-1845).\
  \ During the 19th century, they broadened in scope to include a wide range of new\
  \ information reflecting Scotland\u2019s rapid urbanisation, commercial expansion,\
  \ developments in transportation (including the spread of railways), in public health,\
  \ in schooling, and in recreation. They incorporated new information from state-sponsored\
  \ surveys, including the Ordnance Survey mapping of Scotland, and its standardisation\
  \ of place-names, as well as information from new censuses, and local government.\
  \ For example, the significant changes to county and parish boundaries following\
  \ the Local Government Act (Scotland) 1894 are documented in detail in the Ordnance\
  \ Gazetteer of Scotland (1901), edited by Francis Groome. Many of these gazetteers\
  \ were compiled or published by leading Scottish publishers such as William and\
  \ Robert Chambers, W. &amp; A.K. Johnston, and Archibald Fullarton. Some of their\
  \ editors, such as Samuel Lewis (c.1782 \u2013 1865), and The Reverend John Marius\
  \ Wilson (c.1805\u20131885), also compiled gazetteers of England, Wales and Ireland,\
  \ as well as Scotland. Others, such as John Wood (c.1780\u20131847), were map-makers,\
  \ and his gazetteer accompanied his main work publishing town plans. Their different\
  \ perspectives are all useful, and collectively these gazetteers provide a comprehensive\
  \ geographical encyclopaedia of Scotland in the 19th century.</p>"
