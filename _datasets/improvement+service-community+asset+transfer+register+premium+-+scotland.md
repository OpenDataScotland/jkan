notes: '<p>This dataset is an amalgamation of data related to the Community Empowerment
  (Scotland) Act 2015 and the new duties this places on local authorities.  Part 5:
  Asset Transfer Requests: Provides community bodies with a right to request to purchase,
  lease, manage or use land and buildings belonging to local authorities. Local authorities
  are required to create and maintain a register of land which they will make available
  to the public.  Part 8: Common Good Property: Places a statutory duty on local authorities
  to establish and maintain a register of all property held by them for the common
  good. It also requires local authorities to publish their proposals and consult
  community bodies before disposing of or changing the use of common good assets.  Part
  9: Allotments: It requires local authorities to take reasonable steps to provide
  allotments if waiting lists exceed certain trigger points and strengthens the protection
  for allotments. Provisions allow allotments to be 250 square metres in size or a
  different size that is to be agreed between the person requesting an allotment and
  the local authority. The Act also requires fair rents to be set and allows tenants
  to sell surplus produce grown on an allotment (other than with a view to making
  a profit). There is a requirement for local authorities to develop a food growing
  strategy for their area, including identifying land that may be used as allotment
  sites and identifying other areas of land that could be used by a community for
  the cultivation of vegetables, fruit, herbs or flowers.  SG have provided useful
  guidance of what the register should contain and how it should be formatted (pages
  21-23). https://dtascommunityownership.org.uk/sites/default/files/Asset%20Transfer%20RA%20Guidance%20Notes.pdf</p>'
