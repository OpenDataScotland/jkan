notes: "<div><b>This dataset is published as Open Data and replaces all previously\

  \ 4 Direction</b>\_is a statement made under The Town and Country Planning (General\
  \ Permitted Development) (Scotland) Amendment Order 2011. The Direction, made by\
  \ a local authority and approved by Scottish Ministers, removes all or some of the\
  \ permitted development rights on an area.</div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>The effect\
  \ of a Direction is that planning permission will be required for specific types\
  \ of development which would otherwise have been regarded as 'permitted development',\
  \ and would not have required a planning application.</div>\n<div><br /></div>\n\
  <div>Directions can cover a variety of minor works and might include:</div>\n<div><br\
  \ /></div>\n<div><ul><li>the replacement of doors and windows</li><li>the erection\
  \ of gates</li><li>fences</li><li>garages</li><li>sheds</li><li>porches</li><li>storage\
  \ tanks</li><li>the installation of satellite antennae</li></ul><div><br /></div></div>\n\
  <div>Article 4 Directions complement Conservation Areas and may overlap these \u2013\
  \ in many cases an Article 4 Direction can be applied to a whole Conservation Area\
  \ in order to protect the historic character and setting of the area from inappropriate\
  \ building alterations or development.</div>"
