notes: '<p>The Scottish Vacant and Derelict Land Survey is a national data collection
  undertaken to establish the extent and state of vacant and derelict land in Scotland.
  The survey has been operating since 1988. This survey is associated with the Scottish
  Vacant and Derelict Land Fund, under which cash allocations are made to local authorities.
  \r\n\r\nEvery year the Scottish Government Communities Analytical Services produce
  a comprehensive national survey based on data collected and processed from all Local
  Authorities and Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park Authority. The Spatial Hub
  takes this survey data and joins it (using site ID) to the polygon site information
  provided by local authorities.\r\n\r\nTo create this dataset we have taken all of
  the spatial data provided by councils for the current survey year and combined it
  to this year''s statistical survey (using the site reference). However: \r\n- where
  local authorities have not provided spatial data for the current year, we have used
  their previous spatial data return and matched the survey data as best we can,\r\n-
  where there is no spatial data at all for sites we have buffered the easting and
  northing provided in the survey, to create the rough polygon area for a site.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </p>'
