notes: "<p>Trial the data: The series of British books called the Asian Directories\
  \ and Chronicles was published between 1860 and 1941; the National Library of Scotland\
  \ collection ranges from 1917-1941.\_ Each volume provides listings of active corporations,\
  \ foreign residents and government agencies of all nationalities for that year,\
  \ together with their addresses in countries including Borneo, China, Indo-China,\
  \ Japan, Korea and The Philippines. They were compiled annually from many different\
  \ local sources and research, and were a source of information for both Western\
  \ states and communities of foreigners living in Asia. They included treaties, coverage\
  \ of conflicts, changes in extra-territorial jurisdiction and courts of law, and\
  \ currencies and taxes; the addresses of all corporations and institutions and consulates,\
  \ as well as the occupations and employers of all the foreign residents together\
  \ with their addresses. They also provided information about weights and measures,\
  \ public holidays, festivals and traditions.</p>"
