notes: "<p>Woodland Creation formed part of the Scottish Rural Development Programme\
  \ (SRDP) 2007 - 2013. This SRDP was a programme of economic, environmental and social\
  \ measures, utilising some \u20AC680m of European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development\
  \ funding plus Scottish Government match funding. This programme was designed to\
  \ support rural Scotland from 2007 to 2013. Individuals and groups were able to\
  \ seek funding to help deliver the Government's strategic objectives in rural Scotland.\
  \    Woodlands are a vital sustainable natural resource and funding aims to encourage\
  \ the creation of new woodlands with grants that will contribute to the cost of\
  \ their establishment.    Within Rural Priorities there are eight woodland creation\
  \ options.    Productive conifer woodland (low cost)Productive conifer woodland\

  \ dataset represent the areas which have been approved for new planting. Data is\
  \ captured by the woodland creation option type and by the year the planting is\
  \ intended to take place (claim year).    A boundary which encompasses all the new\
  \ planting options and claim years within a specific case is available in the Woodland\
  \ Creation Boundary RDC dataset.  For more detailed information please see the metadata\
