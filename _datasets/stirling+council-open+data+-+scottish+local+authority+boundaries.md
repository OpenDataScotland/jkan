  <p>Local government in Scotland comprises 32 unitary local authorities, which are
  responsible for the provision of a range of public services such as education, licensing
  regulations, social care, transport and waste management. The current authority
  boundaries are largely a result of reorganization that took place in 1996, following
  the enactment of the Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994 which abolished the
  two tier structure of regions and districts. Boundaries Scotland is responsible
  for recommendations on the definition of local authority boundaries, however, the
  definitive dataset is delineated by Ordnance Survey for inclusion in their BoundaryLine
  product.</p>'
