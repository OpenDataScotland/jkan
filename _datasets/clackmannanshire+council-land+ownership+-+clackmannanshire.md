notes: <p>Local authorities are large owners of land, much of it not captured on the
  current Land Registry due to it not changing hands in the last 40 years. Many do
  not have up to date records of the extent of their land ownership, and as such there
  is no definitive records held. This dataset is trying to collect what information
  does exist to provide an indicative extent of land owned by Local Authorities. This
  is NOT indemnified Registers of Scotland land ownership extents. Some of it is derived
  from sale of land based on historical ownership, but it should not be used for decision
  making, it is designed as an aid to assist interested parties in identifying where
  to start their enquiries. If if doubt please contact the relevant local authority
  or Registers of Scotland.</p>
