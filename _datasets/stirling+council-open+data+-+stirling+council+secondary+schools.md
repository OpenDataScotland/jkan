  <p>Information about Scottish schools are updated by the Scottish Government annually
  for the purposes of monitoring overall performance, equality and individual policies.
  This dataset provides the current geocoded location, contact address, roll numbers,
  teacher numbers, denomination, and proportion of pupils from minority and ethnic
  groups for each primary, secondary and special school in Scotland. Until 2019, these
  updates were reflective of the previous September. The SG School Roll 2023 is reflective
  of the July 2023 schools locations data (published 25th September 2023) and July
  2023 school roll, FTE teachers
