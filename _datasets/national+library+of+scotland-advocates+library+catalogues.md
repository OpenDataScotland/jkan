notes: "<p>Trial the data: The Library of the Faculty of Advocates, whose non-legal\
  \ collections were presented to the National Library of Scotland on its formation\
  \ in 1925, had been collecting books since at least the 1680s. To manage these collections\
  \ the Advocates Library produced several catalogues from the 17 th to the 19 th\
  \ century: each one representing the Library\u2019s evolution from its legal origins\
  \ and the ever expanding number of books that it held. The Library\u2019s first\
  \ printed catalogue was produced at Edinburgh in 1692 by George Mosman and includes\
  \ the Library\u2019s inaugural oration delivered by the Lord Advocate, Sir George\
  \ Mackenzie. This catalogue follows the standard practice of listing books by their\
  \ subject and format with authors alphabetically arranged within each section. The\
  \ Library was small enough at this time to be arranged under just four themes: Law,\
  \ History, Miscellaneous and Theology. It took until well into the 18 th century\
  \ to complete the next catalogue though the completion of its printing is uncertain.\
  \ There is evidence suggesting that copies were finished in 1742, the date later\
  \ put on the title-page when, along with the introduction and the last page, its\
  \ printing was ordered on 13 January 1772. It was printed in Edinburgh by Thomas,\
  \ Walter, and Thomas Ruddiman. As it had been completed 30 years before, a volume\
  \ 2, printed by Balfour and Smellie, and an appendix, printed by William Smellie,\
  \ appeared in 1776 and 1787 respectively. A third part was printed by Alexander\
  \ Smellie in 1807. In 1831 the Faculty ordered the printing by Thomas Clark, an\
  \ Edinburgh bookseller of a catalogue recording only its law books, which was followed\
  \ in 1839 by a supplement. The final catalogue of printed books produced by the\
  \ Faculty before 1925 was based on a slip catalogue prepared by Samuel Halkett.\
  \ He began printing in 1860 and completed it to volume 2, page 104. Volumes 2 and\
  \ 3 and the greater part of volume 4 were edited by Thomas Hill Jamieson, assisted\
  \ by J\xF3n Andr\xE9son Hjaltal\xEDn with the remainder completed by Hjaltal\xED\
  n alone. The part edited by Halkett contains biographical notices and fuller entries.\
  \ All six volumes plus the supplement were printed by William Blackwood and were\
  \ issued between 1867 and 1878.</p>"
