notes: "<p>Stirling Council's Research, Data, and Innovation Team have created two\
  \ interactive StoryMaps, built within our GIS platform, to illustrate Lifestyle\
  \ and Wellbeing information across the council area using CACI's Acorn datasets.</p>\n\
  <p><span>Acorn is a powerful consumer classification tool that segments the UK population\
  \ by postcode. By analysing demographic data, social factors, population and consumer\
  \ behaviour. Acorn provides an understanding of different types of people and places.</span></p>\n\
  <p>With the permission of CACI we are able to publish these StoryMaps for our communities\
  \ to view.\_</p>\n<p>________________________________</p>\n<p><strong>StoryMaps</strong>\
  \ offer a way to interact with our data, allowing a user the ability to move around\
  \ an area of interest, click on a shape to view its pop-up information, or view\
  \ an embedded map in full-screen.</p>\n<p>Simply scroll up and down through the\
  \ Story, just like a normal webpage. If you want to view a map full-screen, click\
  \ on the double arrows in the top right of that map. Images, simply click on an\
  \ image within the <strong>StoryMaps </strong>to view a larger version. Note; some\
  \ of our graphs are embedded images too.</p>"
