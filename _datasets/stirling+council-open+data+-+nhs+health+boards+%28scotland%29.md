  <p>Delivery of frontline healthcare services in Scotland are the responsibility
  of 14 regional National Health Service (NHS) Boards that report to the Scottish
  Government. Current boundaries of NHS Health Boards in Scotland are defined by National
  Health Service (Variation of Areas of Health Boards) (Scotland) Order 2013 (SSI
  2013/347), which came into force on April 1st 2014, and replaces the previous definition
  based upon the former Regions and Districts of the Local Government (Scotland) Act
  1973. This change was made in order to re-align Health Boards with the combined
  area of each Local Authority that they serve. Subsequent changes to Local Authorities
  will result in corresponding amendments to Health Board boundaries in order to maintain
  alignment.</p>'
