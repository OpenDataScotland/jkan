notes: "<p>This dataset is a Scottish Fuel Poverty Index created in the summer of\
  \ 2023 by\n EDINA@University of Edinburgh as part of their student internship programme.\
  \ The user guide provides\n descriptions of each data variable used in creating\
  \ the index. The basic rationale was to replicate for\n Scotland work that had been\
  \ conducted previously but only in respect to England and Wales. The two\n indices\
  \ are not strictly directly comparable due to data availability and spatial granularity\
  \ but provide\n standalone snapshots of relative fuel poverty across Great Britain.\
  \ The Scottish Index is fully open\n source and for purposes of transparency and\
  \ repeatability this guide provides an open methodology\n and is accompanied by\
  \ the underlying data. Data are provided in good faith \u2019as is\u2019 and is\
  \ the sole\n product of student effort as part of mentoring activities conducted\
  \ by EDINA at the University.\n Each variable that was used in the Index was normalised\
  \ relative to the individual values for that\n variable - which means the values\
  \ presented in the underlying FPI data table do not represent the\n actual numbers\
  \ for each local authority - merely the percentage relative to the other local authorities\n\
  \ in Scotland. A separate file \u201DFuel-poverty-index-raw-data-with-calc.csv\u201D\
  \ is available which contains\n the raw percentages used for the index along with\
  \ a table containing the calculations used to obtain\n the final score and the main\
  \ FPI data table.</p>\n<p>Fuel Poverty Index Excel: This file contains each Scottish\
  \ local authority's ability to pay score, demand score and final score which were\
  \ all obtained from the several different variables. The raw data for these variables\
  \ can be found in the Raw Data file and an explanation for each variable can be\
  \ found in the User Guide document. The scores are between 1 to 100 and are normalised\
  \ relative to each other. This means the final scores do not represent the actual\
  \ physical values for each area.</p>\n<p>Fuel Poverty Index csv: This file contains\
  \ the normalised processed data that makes up the Scottish fuel poverty index with\
  \ variables being in range of 1 to 100. Some variables have been weighted depending\
  \ on how important they are to the index. The final scores rating each Scottish\
  \ local authority from 1 to 100 are also included.</p>\n<p>Raw data: This file contains\
  \ the raw unprocessed data that the index was created from for all Scottish local\
  \ authorities. </p>\n<p>User Guide: This file contains the documentation of the\
  \ process to create the index as well as descriptions of what each column in the\
  \ Fuel Poverty Index csv file contain. This file also provides some examples of\
  \ the visualisation created from the index</p>\n<p>Fuel Poverty Index Shapefile:\
  \ This folder contains the .shp shape file comprising all the data from Fuel Poverty\
  \ Index csv, in addition to also having the geospatial polygons associated with\
  \ each local authority boundary. For the best viewing, the British National Grid\
  \ EPSG 27700 coordinate system should be used.</p>"
