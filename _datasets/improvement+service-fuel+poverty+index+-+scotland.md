notes: "<p>This dataset is a Scottish Fuel Poverty Index created in the summer of\
  \ 2023 by\n EDINA@University of Edinburgh as part of their student internship programme.\
  \ The user guide provides\n descriptions of each data variable used in creating\
  \ the index. The basic rationale was to replicate for\n Scotland work that had been\
  \ conducted previously but only in respect to England and Wales. The two\n indices\
  \ are not strictly directly comparable due to data availability and spatial granularity\
  \ but provide\n standalone snapshots of relative fuel poverty across Great Britain.\
  \ The Scottish Index is fully open\n source and for purposes of transparency and\
  \ repeatability this guide provides an open methodology\n and is accompanied by\
  \ the underlying data. Data are provided in good faith \u2019as is\u2019 and is\
  \ the sole\n product of student effort as part of mentoring activities conducted\
  \ by EDINA at the University.\n Each variable that was used in the Index was normalised\
  \ relative to the individual values for that\n variable - which means the values\
  \ presented in the underlying FPI data table do not represent the\n actual numbers\
  \ for each local authority - merely the percentage relative to the other local authorities\n\
  \ in Scotland. A separate file \u201DFuel-poverty-index-raw-data-with-calc.csv\u201D\
  \ is available which contains\n the raw percentages used for the index along with\
  \ a table containing the calculations used to obtain\n the final score and the main\
  \ FPI data table.</p>\n<p>\u2022  Fuel Poverty Index: This file contains the normalised\
  \ processed data that makes up the Scottish fuel poverty index with variables being\
  \ in range of 1 to 100. Some variables have been weighted depending on how important\
  \ they are to the index. The final scores rating each Scottish local authority from\
  \ 1 to 100 are also included at the end column.\n \u2022  Raw data: This file contains\
  \ the raw unprocessed data that the index was created from for all Scottish local\
  \ authorities. </p>"
