  \ and pedestrian data are gathered using cabinets located at the side of footways\
  \ and cycleways, which detect pedestrians using an infra-red beam, and cyclists\
  \ using piezoelectric strips. The devices used are encrypted, and anonymise any\
  \ data collected, so no pedestrians or cyclists can be traced.</p>\n<p style='margin-top:0px;\

  \ sans-serif; font-size:14px;'>The movements which pass through the detection zone\
  \ of the counters are classified based on which sensors are triggered by the movement.\
  \ Where the pedestrian infra-red beam is triggered but not the piezo electric strips,\
  \ the movement is a pedestrian. Where both the infra-red beam and the piezo electric\
  \ strips are triggered, the movement is a cyclist. The piezo electric strips are\
  \ installed below the surface of the footway and so when cut, will fail to record\
  \ anything.</p>\n<p style='margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px; color:rgb(68, 68,\

  \ 2019, the number of locations at which monitors are located increased to 23 with\
  \ the addition of three sites around Craig\u2019s Roundabout. These were installed\
  \ to allow the figures generated from them to be combined with those from the Kerse\
  \ Road Bridge to provide origin-destination data for the network of pathways going\
  \ through the roundabout.</p>\n<p style='margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px; color:rgb(68,\
