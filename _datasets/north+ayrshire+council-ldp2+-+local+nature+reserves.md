notes: <p>LNRs  are  established  in  a  variety   of locations  with  very varied  habitats  and
  species.  They must lie wholly  within  the area of jurisdiction of the local authority
  which  declares them to be reserves.  Prior to  such  declaration, the local  authority
  must  own  or lease the site or  obtain  an agreement from the owner.   LNRs  are  generally
  smaller than NNRs  and closer  to centres of population. They  are frequently  provided
  for the enjoyment and education of local people whose involvement in site management
  is encouraged.</p>
