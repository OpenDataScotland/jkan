notes: <p>The Local Development Plan 2015 was superseded by the Local Development
  Plan 2020 on 27 July 2020. Local Development Plan Rural Grouping Designations have
  been set out within many of the Local Development Plan Rural Groupings. Sites with
  development potential have been identified. These are acceptable in principle subject
  to compliance with the Moray Local Development Plan (MLDP) 2015, but will still
  require confirmation of technical requirements (eg road access; drainage).These
  designations do not imply any right of access or use of private land, nor do they
  commit the Council to any form of maintenance or upkeep of the site.</p>
