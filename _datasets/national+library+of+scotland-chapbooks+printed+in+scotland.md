notes: '<p>Trial the data: This dataset comprises more than 3,000 chapbooks printed
  in Scotland. They form part of the Lauriston Castle Collection, which was bequeathed
  to the Library in 1926. It includes some 500 chapbook volumes containing around
  5,500 individual items, more than half of which were printed in Scotland. Chapbooks
  were staple everyday reading material from the end of the 17 th to the later 19
  th century. They were usually printed on a single sheet and then folded into books
  of 8, 12, 16 and 24 pages, and they were often illustrated with crude woodcuts.
  Their subjects range from news courtship, humour, occupations, fairy tales, apparitions,
  war, politics, crime, executions, historical figures, transvestites and freemasonry
  to religion and, of course, poetry. It has been estimated that around two thirds
  of chapbooks contain songs and poems, often under the title garlands. Chapbooks
  were produced cheaply: the paper was often of low quality, printing type bought
  second-hand produced poor results, and woodcuts were re-used time and time again
  to adorn title pages. Chapbooks were sold by pedlars, so-called chapmen, on streets
  and at fairs, but people could also buy them directly from printing shops. The chapmen
  usually bought a large number of chapbooks on credit from printers and then travelled
  the country for up to six months, selling them for a penny a time along with other
  wares. Provincial booksellers specialised in cheap print much more than metropolitan
  ones. Chapmen were supported by flying stationers to make chapbooks, along with
  broadsides, the most popular reading material for the masses.</p>'
