notes: '<p>This dataset contains areas classified by their suitability for onshore
  wind turbine development, falling into one of three groups:  Group 1: Areas where
  wind farms will not be acceptable: National Parks and National Scenic Areas  Group
  2: Areas of significant protection: Recognising the need for significant protection,
  in these areas wind farms may be appropriate in some circumstances. Further consideration
  will be required to demonstrate that any significant effects on the qualities of
  these areas can be substantially overcome by siting, design or other mitigation.  National
  and international designations:         World Heritage Sites;       Natura 2000
  and Ramsar sites;       Sites of Special Scientific Interest;       National Nature
  Reserves;       Sites identified in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes;       Sites
  identified in the Inventory of Historic Battlefields.  Other nationally important
  mapped environmental interests:         areas of wild land as shown on the 2014
  NatureScot map of wild land areas;      carbon rich soils, deep peat and priority
  peatland habitat.  Community separation for consideration of visual impact: an area
  not exceeding 2km around cities, towns and villages identified on the local development
  plan with an identified settlement envelope or edge. The extent of the area will
  be determined by the planning authority based on landform and other features which
  restrict views out from the settlement.  Group 3 - Area with potential for wind
  farm development:  Beyond groups 1 and 2, wind farms are likely to be acceptable,
  subject to detailed consideration against identified policy criteria. Reference
  should be made to Scottish Government planning and renewable energy policy. In the
  first instance, this is Scottish Planning Policy (June 2014) paragraphs 161 to 174,
  in the context of the overarching policy of "A Low Carbon Place".  It should be
  noted that some terminology relating to "spatial frameworks" and "areas of search"
  may no longer be in use, and reference should be made to planning advice on renewable
  energy (February 2017) at https://www.gov.scot/publications/renewables-planning-advice-index/</p>'
