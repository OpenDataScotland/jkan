notes: <p>Annual update of terminations of pregnancy in Scotland.\r\n\r\nTerminations
  are carried out under the terms of the Abortion Act 1967 with two doctors agreeing
  that a termination of pregnancy is necessary under at least one of the Grounds as
  specified in the 1991 Regulations. There is a legal requirement on service providers
  to notify the Chief Medical Officer for Scotland (CMO) of all terminations under-taken
  in Scotland. Prior to 1st May 2022 PHS received termination data from the CMO. Since
  1st May 2022 PHS has received this data direct from termination services on the
  Termination of Pregnancy Submissions Scotland (ToPSS) system. \r\nAn abortion can
  be induced (therapeutic) or spontaneous (miscarriage) and may be carried out either
  surgically (eg vacuum aspiration, dilation and curettage) or medically using two
  drugs, an antiprogesterone and a prostaglandin. This report focuses only on induced
  abortions. We also refer to these as terminations of pregnancy to avoid confusion
  with spontaneous abortions.\r\n\r\nInformation is provided by age, gestation, method
  of termination, NHS board of residence, deprivation area, previous termination and
  council area of residence.\r\n\r\nFor more information on terminations of pregnancy
