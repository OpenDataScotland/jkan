notes: <p><strong>As of 27/09/2022, this dataset has been superseded by a new version
  found <a href="https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/drug-and-alcohol-treatment-waiting-times">here</a></strong>\r\n\r\nThis
  data provides a quarterly update on waiting times for people accessing specialist
  drug and alcohol treatment services. In 2011, the Scottish Government set a standard
  that 90% of people referred for help with problematic drug or alcohol use will wait
  no longer than three weeks for specialist treatment that supports their recovery.
  This data was extracted from the new Drug and Alcohol Information System (DAISy)
  and its predecessor the Drug and Alcohol Treatment Waiting Times (DATWT) database.
  DAISy was implemented in four NHS Boards (Ayrshire &amp; Arran, Dumfries &amp; Galloway,
  Grampian and Western Isles) from December 2020, and was available in all NHS Boards
  from April 2021.\r\n\r\nAll publications and supporting material to this topic area
