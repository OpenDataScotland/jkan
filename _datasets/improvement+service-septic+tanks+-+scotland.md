notes: <p>This dataset is an amalgamation of licenced SEPA, Scottish Water &amp; some
  Local Authority Septic Tanks in Scotland.  Under section 79 of the Environmental
  Protection Act 1990 and Under part 6, section 37 of the Water Resources (Scotland)
  Act 2013 SEPA, Scottish Water and Local Authorities all have a responsibility for
  the registration, management and compliance of Septic Tanks within Scotland. The
  Scottish Assessors also currently identifies 678 septic tanks. These are tanks that
  serve more than one dwelling. Those that serve just one dwelling may be treated
  as an appurtenance of the dwelling i.e. they are classified as domestic and treated
  as being reflected in the Council Tax band.  SEPA have approximately a quarter of
  the Septic Tanks mapped as it has only been a requirement since 2012 that when buying
  or selling a house that these get licenced. Scottish Water have partial information
  and the Scottish Assessors collect some as well. SEPA, Local Authorities, Scottish
  Water and Scottish Assessors are keen to combine data to create a complete and comprehensive
  view of all Septic Tanks in Scotland, although this work is not yet compete</p>
